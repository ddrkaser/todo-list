MRMC has considered the mitigants provided by 1LOD in response to MRM's memo while drafting validation issue 10, which addresses concerns regarding the operational effectiveness of BTL sampling and testing. As a result, the severity of this issue has been downgraded to 4. However, despite the counter-arguments presented, MRMC maintains that the issue still requires remediation. Below are some recommendations that the Model Owner should consider during the remediation process:

1. Ensure that the model documentation clearly explains how the guidance in ES-7 is applied in the context of SAM FSI. This includes demonstrating how the sampling process aligns with the conceptual BTL region. ES-7 provides high-level guidance and includes a range of potential actions. As a result, it may create transparency issues for third-party reviewers, making it difficult for them to understand what specific actions were taken during the revalidation process and the considerations behind them.

2. The rationale behind parameter choices for BTL must be explainable at the rule-population group level. Currently, these decisions are too broad to adequately justify the rule-specific objectives and risk coverage in both conceptual and statistical soundness assessments. The same applies to BTL drop levels. The justification for chosen thresholds and the corresponding percentage drops, alongside the statistical soundness assessment, based on ES-7 guidance (or rationalized where overridden by FCP's recommendations), is not sufficiently explained.
