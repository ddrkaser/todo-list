MRMC has made the following observations based on the extract, which are summarized in Table 9:

MRMC has found that out of the five controls, two controls generated a 0% inquiry ratio within the reviewed time window.

MRMC has concluded that the parameters for both Frequent Trading Reports and Moving The Grid controls are not adequately tuned. They request additional tuning and/or testing from MO to demonstrate the appropriateness and stability of these parameters.

In conclusion, the model owner did not conduct a sufficiently rigorous evaluation of control parameters to ensure they have been properly tuned to 's specific risk profile and appetite. Specifically, the parameters for Frequent Trading Reports and Moving The Grid, where tuning is possible, should be thoroughly tested and justified. Otherwise, adjustments should be made to ensure the model functions as intended.

The model owner has confirmed that MO conducted BTL testing only for the Frequent Trading control in June 2022 (NMMC-253016). There have been no additional BTL tests conducted, and there are currently no plans for BTL testing for other controls [01].

As a result, MRMC has raised issue 4, highlighting that further investigation is needed regarding the robustness of calibration, particularly concerning the Frequent Trading Reports and Moving The Grid controls.
