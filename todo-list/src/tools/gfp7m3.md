As the revalidation process continues, we've observed the occurrence of several alerts being "soft deleted." However, we couldn't locate any documents or records detailing the "soft delete" process. I would like to request the following information:

1. A list of alerts that have been "soft deleted" between April 2022 and March 2023.
2. Relevant records or communications, including the requesting party, date, and the impact of these deletions.
3. Procedures and criteria that outline the qualifications for alerts eligible for "soft deletion."
4. Any controls or safeguards in place for this process, such as the application of the "4-eyes principle."

This information will help us better understand the "soft delete" process and its implications. Thank you for your assistance.
