MO explained that the model's primary use case is to risk score email addresses targeted to receive Overdrive (BUSA) offer codes and apply for a checking account. If the model flags certain email addresses, they will not be eligible to receive BUSA offer codes, unless they are cleared through manual review. To mitigate false positives and any subsequent negative client experience, impacted clients will be provided with alternative channels, such as contacting the Digital Banking Specialist through the contact center, to open a new BUSA checking/saving account.

In cases of poor quality forecasts, a feedback loop will serve as a mechanism to identify and address any issues related to the model's performance. Since the model does not feed into any other business applications, MRMC agrees with the model owner's assessment and supports the view that the model's impact in this context is immaterial.
