We would like to receive confirmation that the feeder models (MMC-11 in 7904 and MMC-4 in 104882) were indeed changed during the recalibration process on SRT risk themes. Additionally, we would like to ensure that the input data before and after the feeder model change have been reconciled. Specifically, we need assurance that there has been no negative impact on the input data as a result of the feeder model change. If there are any observed impacts, we kindly request confirmation that the new feeder models have better data quality.

Good afternoon, I'm contacting you to inquire about the possibility of occasionally working at the Stamford office. I recently relocated to Connecticut because my wife has become a professor at a university in CT. Yesterday, Hardik informed me that Monojit occasionally visits the Stamford office, which has sparked my curiosity about the potential for me to work there on certain occasions. I highly appreciate your time and assistance. Thank you kindly.

MO explained that the use case of the model which is to help conduct targeted marketing efforts to increase SBL loan utilization and improve probability of their repayments. Model output is list of SL accounts with propensity score generated. The score is a product of likelihood and the value of expected SBL paydowns / new draws over the next month.
MRMC agrees with the model owner's assessment and supports model immateriality in this context, considering there is also current traditional approach (e.g. rule based campaign, etc.) that are used. If the model output quality is consistently detoriarated over an extended period of time, this would result inaccurate model scores which will be ultimatley lead to reaching out to many FAs who are unlikely to utilize SL loan, which can have a limited impact (on UBS reputation). In cases of poor quality forecasts FAs would also possibly complain and this would be a mechanism to notice poor model performance. Considering that and given the model does not feed into any other business applications, MRMC agrees with the model owner's assessment and supports model immateriality in this context.
