MRMC has determined that the parameters for both Frequent Trading Reports and Moving The Grid controls are not sufficiently tuned. The remediation action proposed by MO should incorporate additional tuning and/or testing, such as BTL testing, to showcase the appropriateness and stability of these parameters. If the remediation action extends beyond 12 months, MO should also furnish adequate justification for the prolonged timeline.
