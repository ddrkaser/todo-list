Furthermore, if VAA's absence does not significantly affect the fraud detection algorithm, could you explain how the remaining two models will sufficiently prevent fraudulent activities?"

""" Failure to prevent fraudulent transactions will pose reputational risk, customers will lose faith in fraud protection provided by the firm thus pursue a more secured service provider. Please explain how can the two other models cover all potential risks/losses derived from VAA's failure?

Please give more details about how a fraudulent transactions is detected by this model and criteria to block or approve a transaction, how does it work with the other models in TSYS. Please provide more metrics to verify the model's performance. Such as GINI coefficient test, KS-statistic, and false positive rate in the previous validation report.
