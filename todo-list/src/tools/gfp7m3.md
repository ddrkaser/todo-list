Certainly, here's an improved version of your text:

1. Our records indicate a gap in the KMPI reports and RAG status between September 2022 and November 2022 from the previous confirmation period until August 2022. Could you kindly provide this missing information?

2. Referring to page 9, Section 2.6.1 (Above the Line/Below the Line Testing) of the document [_ModelConfirmation_2023_v1.0], point 4 mentions the submission of BTL testing during revalidation. However, we only received the SAM FSI BTL Testing 2023 Summary.xlsx, which appears incomplete due to the absence of further BTL testing recommendations or conclusions.

3. As stated in [MC-10] RE_FS Model Confirmation-Model Technology Section, there were recent upgrades in the FS/BUSA environment from Oracle 11g to 19c. Could you provide details about any ongoing evaluations related to this transition? Page 7, Section 2.1.4 (Model Technology) of [_ModelConfirmation_2023_v1.0] mentioned database upgrades, but such information wasn't found in [_Upgrade_Testing_Document_v1.0.pdf] submitted with NMMC-.

4. The document [_ModelConfirmation_2023_v1.0] refers to SAM V9; however, SAM V8 seems more pertinent for the current confirmation due to the following reasons:
    - This confirmation period aims to review model risk and MPMC concepts from September 2022 to October 2023, aligning with SAM V8's production.
    - The submission for the V9 upgrade (NMMC-261265) occurred on October 10th, 2023, awaiting approval from MRMC.
    - The majority of references cited in [ModelConfirmation_2023_v1.0] pertain to SAM V8, including the model documentation [MC-13] DRAFT_FSI SAM v8 Model Document_v3.3.

In summary, could you kindly assist by:
1. Providing the missing KMPI reports and RAG status for the period between September 2022 and November 2022.
2. Sharing BTL testing recommendations or conclusions based on the latest BTL sample review.
3. Offering additional details regarding the mentioned database upgrades in point 3.
4. Updating [_ModelConfirmation_2023_v1.0] to correct the reference from V9 to V8 and adjusting the confirmation analysis accordingly based on SAM V8.

Please let me know if further clarification is required. Your time and assistance in this matter are greatly appreciated.

Subject: Inquiry Regarding SAM FS 2023 Confirmation


I hope this message finds you well. I am currently in the process of reviewing the 2023 confirmation and have a few queries that require your assistance:

1. Could you kindly provide the KMPI reports and RAG status for the period between September 2022 and November 2022? These seem to be missing from our records.

2. Referring to page 9, Section 2.6.1 (Above the Line/Below the Line Testing) of document [_ModelConfirmation_2023_v1.0], point 4 mentions the submission of BTL testing during the revalidation. However, we have only received the SAM FSI BTL Testing 2023 Summary.xlsx, which appears incomplete due to the absence of further BTL testing recommendations or conclusions. Could you provide these based on the latest BTL sample review?

3. I refer to [MC-10] RE_FS Model Confirmation-Model Technology Section, where it is indicated that the FS/BUSA environment underwent upgrades from Oracle 11g to 19c. I would appreciate any available evaluation on this transition. Although Page 7, Section 2.1.4. of [_ModelConfirmation_2023_v1.0] mentions database upgrades, we couldn't locate detailed information within the submitted document [Upgrade_Testing_Document_v1.0.pdf] accompanying NMMC-.

4. Document [_ModelConfirmation_2023_v1.0] references SAM V9; however, SAM V8 appears more relevant for the current confirmation due to the following reasons:
    - The confirmation aims to review model risk and MPMC concepts between September 2022 and October 2023, a period when SAM V8 was in production.
    - The NMMC- for V9 upgrade was submitted on October 10th, 2023, and is pending approval by MRMC.
    - The majority of references in [_ModelConfirmation_2023_v1.0] pertain to SAM V8, including the model documentation [MC-13] DRAFT_FSI SAM v8 Model Document_v3.3.

In summary, I kindly request the following actions:
1. Provision of the missing KMPI reports and RAG status between September 2022 and November 2022.
2. Submission of the BTL testing recommendations/conclusions based on the latest BTL sample review.
3. Further details regarding the database upgrades mentioned in point 3.
4. Updating [_ModelConfirmation_2023_v1.0] to reflect V8 instead of V9 and adjusting the confirmation analysis based on SAM V8.

Your prompt assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any additional information or clarification is required. Thank you very much for your time and support.

Best Regards,
