MRMC has identified several issues that need to be addressed:

1. Clarity in Model Outputs: The presentation lacks clear definition of model outputs. For instance, specifying that the model score ranges from 0 to 100, where 100 indicates the highest likelihood of FA success at UBS and 0 indicates the lowest. Additionally, it's suggested to rank FAs based on their model scores and assign star ratings accordingly, from 1 star to 5.

2. Justification of KMPI Parts and Lift Rate: 
    a. Clarify how lift rate serves as an indicator of model performance.
    b. Explain the calculation method for T12 of the top decile and whether all top FAs are recruited through the model.
    c. Provide an example illustrating how lift rates can indicate model performance.

3. Documentation Gaps in Model Inputs: 
    a. Clearly outline the feature engineering process for categorical data, as well as handling of scaling, outliers, and missing values.
    b. Justify the relevance of the external discovery data and explain how it complements the internal FA dataset.
    c. Establish connections between internal and external data sources, highlighting significant business factors and their impact on model output scores.

4. Documentation Gaps in Model Methodology: 
    a. Include tests on variable selection, handling of hyperparameters, and methodology choice.
    b. Explain the process of selecting explanatory variables from a pool of available drivers from publicly available data.
    c. Describe the out-of-sample testing procedure, including possible comparisons between in-sample and out-of-sample AuC and indications of overfitting.

5. Documentation Gaps in Model Use: 
    a. Confirm whether the final model output consists solely of star ratings or if there are other outputs presented in the dashboard.

6. Documentation Gaps in Model Implementation: 
    a. Clarify how the model is examined and by whom.
    b. Define what constitutes satisfactory results in model testing and implementation.
