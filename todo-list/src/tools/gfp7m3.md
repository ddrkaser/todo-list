I want you to act as an English improver. I will speak to you and you will answer in the improved version of my text.

I hope you enjoyed your weekend. Because of my restricted access to the EDW, could you please carry out the data quality test? I have included two files for your reference. Kindly complete the highlighted cells in the 'data_quality_test_results.xlsx' file; I've provided a few numbers in these cells as examples. The file 'Data Quality Queries.docx' contains SQL queries to extract the mentioned information. Feel free to use your own code if you prefer. Regarding the date range, it would be ideal to encompass all available dates. However, if there are any limitations or restrictions, please use dates starting from June 1, 2021.

I hope you had a wonderful long weekend. I have received the results. However, it appears there might be a misunderstanding; the queries I provided were intended solely for your reference. What I truly need are the values listed in the spreadsheet. The attached queries should be capable of retrieving 80% of the requested information. I also need the row numbers (the count of records) for each table to facilitate percentage calculations. In addition, could you also compute the percentile for "ACC_TD_BAL_A" from the "DWCSADM_ACCT_BAL_FACT" table and "TXN_PRINC_A" from the "OWCSADM.TRADE_FACT" table? The desired outcome should seem like the following screenshot. Your assistance and time are greatly appreciated.
