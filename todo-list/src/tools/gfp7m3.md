We would like to receive confirmation that the feeder models (MMC-11 in 7904 and MMC-4 in 104882) were indeed changed during the recalibration process on SRT risk themes. Additionally, we would like to ensure that the input data before and after the feeder model change have been reconciled. Specifically, we need assurance that there has been no negative impact on the input data as a result of the feeder model change. If there are any observed impacts, we kindly request confirmation that the new feeder models have better data quality.

Good afternoon, I'm contacting you to inquire about the possibility of occasionally working at the Stamford office. I recently relocated to Connecticut because my wife has become a professor at a university in CT. Yesterday, Hardik informed me that Monojit occasionally visits the Stamford office, which has sparked my curiosity about the potential for me to work there on certain occasions. I highly appreciate your time and assistance. Thank you kindly.

MO explained that the model's use case is to assist in conducting targeted marketing efforts aimed at increasing SBL loan utilization and improving the probability of loan repayments. The model generates a list of SL accounts with propensity scores. These scores are calculated based on the likelihood and the expected value of SBL paydowns or new draws in the upcoming month.

MRMC has reviewed the model documentation and supporting materials. If the quality of the model output consistently deteriorates over an extended period, it could result in inaccurate model scores. Ultimately, this could lead to reaching out to many FAs who are unlikely to utilize SL loans. However, this limited impact on UBS reputation is mitigated by the fact that the model is used in conjunction with traditional approaches.

In instances of poor quality forecasts, FAs may provide feedback, which serves as a mechanism for identifying and addressing poor model performance. Given that the model does not feed into any other business applications, MRMC agrees with the model owner's assessment and supports the view that the model's impact is insignificant in this context.

MO explained that the model's primary use case is to assist in comparing it against any active models within the Alloy Control Suite, targeting Synthetic fraud. This comparison is done by measuring key performance indicators such as false positive/negative rates and detection rate. The model will be used solely in monitoring mode, meaning its outputs will not impact the fraud screening process for new Overdrive BUSA accounts.

MRMC has thoroughly reviewed the model documentation and supporting materials. In the event that the quality of the model output consistently deteriorates over an extended period, it would have a negligible impact as it does not influence the fraud screening decision process for new Overdrive BUSA accounts. It's important to note that the model's output does not contribute to any regulatory reporting.

Considering that the model doesn't serve other business applications, MRMC agrees with the model owner's assessment and supports the view that the model's impact in this context is immaterial.

The model's use is strictly limited to monitoring key performance indicators of fraud and has no impact on the decision process of fraud screening. In cases where the model becomes unavailable, Alloy offers the option to substitute 'Secondary Data Providers' as specified in the contractual agreement with Alloy.

However, we must consider the internal implications and processes on the UBS side, particularly concerning Model Validation, Governance, and Approval. Integrating a new data provider model and obtaining validation and approval could take up to 6 months before we can request Alloy to enable it in our environments. To ensure clarity and precision, it is essential to create a separate process/procedure document that outlines these steps in more detail.

MO explained that the model's primary use case is to risk score email addresses targeted to receive Overdrive (BUSA) offer codes and apply for a checking account. Email addresses flagged by the model will not be eligible to receive BUSA offer codes unless they are cleared based on manual review. False positives and subsequent negative client experience impacts will be mitigated by offering impacted dients with alternative channels to open a new BUSA checking/saving account (i.e. via contact center

In instances of poor quality forecasts, feedback loop will serve as a mechanism for identifying and addressing poor model performance. Given that the model does not feed into any other business applications, MRMC agrees with the model owner's assessment and supports the view that the model's immaterialitv in this context.
