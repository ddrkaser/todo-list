While reviewing the BTL productivity ratio, MRMC identified that two rules, "" and "," have a BTL productivity ratio greater than 3%. However, the justifications provided by the Model Owner (MO) in the "Proposed_Threshold_Settings" tab of the rule sheets "" and "" are not sufficiently articulated.

In particular, for rule "" the MO states that "In order to assess the appropriateness of the threshold setting, the Model Owner conducted BTL testing on the relevant parameters for this rule (the parameters identified to be relevant for BTL testing are defined in the 'Conceptual&StatisticalSoundness' tab).

(1) For this rule, 92 BTL alerts were reviewed. Of these, 3 alerts were found productive. Based on these observations, the Model Owner identified the threshold as appropriate and deemed no adjustment necessary for this threshold. [Refer to BM-9]. This is in line with the defined threshold adjustment decision-making process noted in ES-7 in the model documentation."

Could you please articulate why the MO identified the threshold as appropriate and deemed no adjustment necessary? Additionally, which procedures, processes, and criteria described in BM-9 and ES-7 did the MO follow to arrive at this conclusion?

please provide more detailed evidence and explanation on how the MO concluded that the threshold is appropriate and no adjustment is necessary for the rule ""? Specifically, we would like to understand the following:

What specific criteria were used to determine the appropriateness of the threshold?
Can you provide a detailed breakdown of the BTL testing process, including how the relevant parameters were identified and assessed?
What specific observations and analyses led to the conclusion that 3 productive alerts out of 92 BTL alerts justify the current threshold setting?
How do the procedures, processes, and criteria described in BM-9 and ES-7 support this conclusion? Could you provide specific references or examples from these documents that guided the decision-making process?
