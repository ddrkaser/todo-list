The BTL testing process is compromised by flawed sampling methodology, inconsistent population sizes, and a lack of transparency. Key parameters were incorrectly applied, leading to unrepresentative sample sizes, while critical score parameters were inadequately tested. Discrepancies between the described and executed sampling strategies further undermine the process, with insufficient documentation on the techniques used. These issues collectively question the reliability and effectiveness of the BTL testing.
