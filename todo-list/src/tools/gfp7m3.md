MRMC Review:
MRMC has reviewed the updated model documentation in [M1, Section 4.1.6] and confirms that all assumptions and limitations have been categorized as either key or non-key. Assumptions have been further categorized as either expert or analytical. Additionally, updated assumptions and limitations align with MRMP. MRMC has also confirmed that risk mitigation and controls are in place. However, MRMC notes that the justification for key/non-key assumptions is inadequate, and a non-critical validation issue 3 regarding documentation gaps has been raised.

MRMC Conclusion:
In conclusion, MRMC deems that all assumptions and limitations have been appropriately categorized. Assumptions have been classified as either expert or analytical, and they align with MRMP. Risk mitigation and controls are in place. Therefore, this issue can be closed.
