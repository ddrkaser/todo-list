1.What were your core contributions? What was the impact of your achievements?

This year, I independently worked on revalidating 12915 and 7904 model. Simultaneously, I collaborated with my teammates on revalidating 9448 and 102646 model. My role involved identifying and mitigating risks associated with model risk dimensions, ensuring that the models comply with regulatory requirements to prevent legal and financial repercussions. I also diligently monitored the Key Model Performance Indicators (KMPIs) to ensure that the models operate in accordance with established guidelines. If any of the KMPIs indicated a failure, my responsibilities included collaborating with the model developer to identify and document the issues. Furthermore, I reviewed the remediation plan proposed by the model developer to address and rectify any identified issues.

2.What are your opportunities to develop and improve? In what areas could you be more impactful?

There are opportunities for improvement in transaction models which serves as the foundation of our financial crime prevention efforts. However, this area has faced ongoing challenges including slow and extended tuning cycles, limitations in typology coverage, and technological constraints. These issues have, on occasion, resulted in the failure to detect suspicious activities and the misallocation of valuable resources to false positives, causing unnecessary disruptions. While working with these models, I have honed the ability to assess data integrity by extracting transactions from an SQL database and conducting independent tests in parameter tuning to enhance its performance, thereby reducing false positive rates while maintaining a high level of risk coverage.

Furthermore, I have gained experience in evaluating detection thresholds and scores to effectively calibrate the transaction monitoring system. The key insight from this experience is the importance of ensuring that the model owner carefully optimizes these parameters, which can subsequently enhance the model's ability to identify suspicious activities while minimizing unnecessary alerts, ultimately improving the efficiency of the monitoring process.

3.Outline the strengths you have demonstrated that exemplified behaviors. Provide examples on how you can better demonstrate the behaviors going forward.

Throughout the validation process, I established regular communication channels with model owners to address model documentation submission, missing items, documentation issues, and other queries. I have exhibited the following strengths:

Demonstrated open and transparent communication to facilitate mutual understanding and collaborative issue resolution.
Displayed reliability, honesty, and a commitment to keeping promises.
Effectively collaborated with colleagues, shared responsibilities, and worked towards common objectives.
Treated others with respect, valuing their opinions and contributions.
Exhibited a willingness to adapt to new circumstances and embrace change.
