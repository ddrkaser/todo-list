The figure identifies 12 pairs of rules with an overlap exceeding 70%. Such a high overlap suggests potential redundancy between these rules. Among these 12 pairs, one noteworthy case is AML-CTSD-MSG-BEN-P-D01-CTY (Daily Messages From High-Risk Countries), which exhibits substantial overlap with multiple rules, including AML-HBC-IFT-INN-A-M01-HBN (Incoming High-Risk Fund Transfers Volume Historical Profile Deviation). This observation raises the possibility that the logic of these rules may contain redundancy, and the thresholds may require fine-tuning to effectively distinguish between transactional patterns monitored by these designated rules.

Furthermore, an additional analysis by MRMC has revealed that 3 pairs of rules exhibit significant overlap. These rules are AML-EBO-IFT-ALL-A-D05-EOP (Burst in Originator Activity - Short Period), AML-EFT-IFT-INN-A-S01-EST (Excessive Incoming High-Risk Fund Transfers), and AML-EFT-IFT-OUT-A-501 EST (Excessive Outgoing High-Risk Fund Transfers). MRMC's in-depth analysis indicates that these rules belong to similar typologies. The high correlation between these rule pairs can be attributed to their shared focus on monitoring transactional patterns, either from the beneficiary or the originator activity perspective. Specifically, they cover Burst in beneficiary activity, Excessive fund transfers typology, Burst in Originator activity, Burst in beneficiary activity, and Historical Behavior Comparison. This suggests potential opportunities for optimizing and streamlining these rules for more effective monitoring.
