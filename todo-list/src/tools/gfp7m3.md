**Subject:** Clarification on Issue 258189: Insufficient Justification for the Choice of Risk Tolerance  

I would like to provide some clarification regarding Issue 258189: *Insufficient Justification for the Choice of Risk Tolerance*.

1. **Definition of False Negative Rate (FNR):**  
   The formula FNR = FN / (FN + TP) is the correct definition of the false negative rate. I agree that using this calculation does not make sense in the current context. However, in BM5 Appendix E, the 10% is inaccurately referred to as the FNR. If you agree with the proper definition of FNR, could you update the document to rephrase the 10% as your "risk tolerance rate" instead of FNR?

2. **Purpose of the 10% Tolerance Rate:**  
   Our 10% risk tolerance is not used for sample size calculation. The OCC Handbook uses the tolerance rate specifically for statistical sampling exercises (e.g., sample size calculation), which is a different context altogether.

3. **Risk Tolerance and the BTL Process:**  
   Although the risk tolerance is not directly applied during the BTL process, the number of productive alerts generated as a result of the BTL is compared against the risk tolerance. Assuming the sampling is done correctly, the number of productive alerts can be calculated as:  
   **Number of Sample Productive Alerts = Sample Size Ã— Sample Productive Rate**  

   If the sample size is larger, as seen in the 2023 BTL, we are more likely to breach the risk tolerance. Please refer to the attached file for a detailed comparison.

Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
