For NFRs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.1, and 15.1, the correlations between selected variables and the predicted variable exhibit significant weakness. The rationale behind the SME-selected variables lacks clarity to sufficiently support the variable selection process. Therefore, additional feedback from Subject Matter Experts on the final champion model is crucial to comprehensively understand the connection between economic variables and risk themes.

Additionally, as indicated in the SME review minutes [M15], the NFR 2 taxonomy owner expressed reservations, stating that none of the presented models appear suitable for forecasting losses within this taxonomy. Consequently, MRMC has imposed restrictions on using statistical regressions for these NFRs. Instead, a fallback approach is highly recommended for more reliable outcomes in these cases.
