MRMC has conducted an assessment to determine if the MPMC concept aligns with Model Performance Monitoring and Confirmation principles. MRMC has verified that the proposed KMPIs for the model and their monitoring frequency are appropriate. They have ensured that KMPIs are established for each dimension of model risk and have assessed the comprehensiveness of the proposed confirmation scope to maintain the model's ongoing fitness for its intended purpose.

Upon reviewing the MPMC concept submitted by the model owner, MRMC has found that the KMPIs proposed for the model are well-defined and align with the model's purpose and usage. The documentation includes KMPIs that encompass various aspects such as input data, outputs, model stability, process, and outstanding findings.

The model owner has provided pass/fail thresholds for each KMPI, which will help identify breaches, along with follow-up and remediation actions in case of such breaches. KMPI monitoring results will be documented and stored as outlined in the MPMC principles, and the model owner has confirmed the feasibility of executing these KMPIs, backed by sufficient evidence.

The monitoring frequency for the KMPIs varies from monthly to quarterly, which is consistent with the model's infrequent operation in a stable UBS IT environment.

However, MRMC has identified a deficiency concerning KMPI 0.3. Specifically, KMPI 0.3 only monitors the overall model output inquiry ratio, rather than tracking the inquiry ratio for each individual rule separately. This design oversight fails to provide adequate justification for recalibrating the Frequent Trading and Moving The Grid controls, contributing to issue 5.

Furthermore, this deficiency also plays a role in issue 3, where the re-calibration process is not sufficiently justified.
