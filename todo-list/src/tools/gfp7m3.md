The assumption has not been adequately evaluated by the MO. It applies a 15% threshold drop for the BTL analysis, but there may be conditions—such as a breach in hypothesis testing or data skewness—where a further reduction could be necessary. However, no justification or sufficient testing has been provided to support the selection of a 15% drop. Additionally, some BTL tuning parameters are integer values, and it is unclear whether this 15% drop approach applies to those parameters as well. Furthermore, there is no clarity on why the conditions mentioned in the assumption (i.e., a breach in hypothesis testing or data skewness) would require a greater reduction in the threshold or what the appropriate increase in drop should be. It is also not explained whether additional action will be taken to meet the required sample size if the initial threshold drop fails to produce a sufficient or meaningful base population. These issues contribute to finding 15.
