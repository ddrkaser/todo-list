MRMC has reviewed the methodology and materials provided by the owner of EJDA. The combined adjustment approach can be summarized as follows:

1. Regression Models (QLM / Run Rate):
The results are to be aggregated without requiring any adjustment. Although the regression model approaches differ between UBS and CS, the ratio of small to large losses is reasonably similar for the ISA scenarios. Results for each entity were obtained through validated methodologies and should be considered accurate for all scenarios (baseline, internal severely adverse, and Fed severely adverse).

2. Scenario Add-ons (Idiosyncratic / Large Loss):
The results are to be aggregated, with adjustments made for scenario overlaps and an additional scenario to account for integration risks. Scenarios were approved by each entity's subject matter experts (SMEs), reflecting specific forward-looking (and, in S' case, historical) risks. Adjustments are necessary for duplication or overlap of risks across UBS and CS scenarios, as well as for additional risks that may arise from integration. This adjustment is applicable only to stress scenarios. The UBS standalone scenario add-on exists only for the internal severely adverse scenario, so the adjustment for duplication/overlap does not apply for the Fed severely adverse scenario. The integration risks addition applies to all stress scenarios.

3. Litigation Add-on:
The results are to be aggregated without requiring any adjustment. Independent SME assessment was based on currently open litigation cases. This applies only to stress scenarios where the add-on is applicable.

Outcome of MRMC's Assessment:

1. MRMC has reviewed the proposed approach to aggregate results from both UBS and CS on a comparable level and concluded that the model methodology is broadly fit for purpose based on the evaluation of the conceptual framework. MRMC has also reviewed the methodology rationale to ensure that although the two regression model approaches differ, the loss projection methodologies are reasonably equivalent across the entities, meaning the methodologies are similar enough to enable a direct aggregation approach for regression model results. MRMC notes that the results of both entities were achieved through validated methodologies and should be considered accurate.

2. When adjusting scenario add-ons, MRMC deems that scenarios were reviewed and approved by each entity's SMEs, reflecting specific scenarios based on forward-looking risks. Adjustments should be made for duplication of risks across UBS and CS scenarios to account for additional risks that may arise as a result of integration. Additionally, MRMC has confirmed that adjustment for overlap only applies for the internal severely adverse scenario, as the idiosyncratic add-on is excluded in the Fed severely adverse case.
