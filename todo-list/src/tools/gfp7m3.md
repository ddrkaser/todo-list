### 1 - Strengths and Achievements: What were your core contributions this year? What was the impact of your achievements?

This year, I led revalidations for the 102646 SAM FS and 251242 HOLT Valuation models. Additionally, I collaborated with my teammates on projects including the 105502 Equifax confirmation, 12915 RDS issue closure, 103353 CRR validation report, and initial validation of immaterial models. My role involved identifying and mitigating risks across key model risk dimensions, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards to minimize legal and financial risks. I also closely monitored the Key Model Performance Indicators (KMPIs) to confirm that models functioned within established parameters. If any KPI flagged a deviation, I worked with the model developer to identify, document, and address the issue. Furthermore, I reviewed the remediation actions proposed by the developer to resolve and rectify any identified concerns.

### 2 - Development Areas: What are your opportunities to develop and improve? In what areas could you be more impactful?

I see opportunities to enhance my skills in validating transaction models, which form the core of our financial crime prevention framework. This area faces ongoing challenges, such as prolonged tuning cycles, gaps in typology coverage, and technical constraints. These limitations have sometimes led to missed detections of suspicious activities and the misallocation of resources to false positives, causing unnecessary disruptions. Given the strict AML regulations, these models receive intense regulatory scrutiny. Through my involvement in the MRA issue closure, I have strengthened my ability to manage challenging stakeholder conversations, exchange ideas on addressing underlying issues, and collaborate effectively with model owners, sharing responsibilities toward common objectives. 

Additionally, I have gained experience in evaluating detection thresholds and scores, which is essential for fine-tuning the transaction monitoring system. A key takeaway from this experience is the importance of calibrating these parameters carefully, which can improve the model’s capability to identify suspicious activities while reducing false alerts, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the monitoring process.

### 3 - UBS Behaviors: Outline the strengths you have demonstrated that exemplified Behaviors. Provide examples on how you can better demonstrate the Behaviors going forward.

Throughout the validation process, I maintained open and regular communication with model owners to discuss documentation submissions, resolve any gaps, and address related queries. This commitment to open and transparent communication has fostered mutual understanding and enabled collaborative problem-solving. I have consistently demonstrated reliability, integrity, and a commitment to honoring my responsibilities. Additionally, I have shown respect for my colleagues, valuing their perspectives and contributions.

In my spare time, I have also contributed to MRMC innovation. This year, I developed "Trackit," a Python tool designed to streamline our book of work management, issue tracking, and project management in GitLab. This tool enhances workflow efficiency and supports the team’s commitment to continuous improvement.
