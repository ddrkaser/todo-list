For some parameters, the selected thresholds do not appear to be consistent across each population group (i.e., they are positioned at different points within the distribution of each population). The thresholds are also inconsistent across the clusters, which were calculated based on transaction value and volume, and assigned into three clusters (1 to 3). However, there are instances where the threshold for Cluster 2 is higher than for Cluster 3. For example, in the case of rule "PRJ, the thresholds for , , and  are 11,500, 57,500, and 34,500, respectively. This inconsistency, where Cluster 2 has the highest threshold, raises concerns about the logic behind the threshold setting.

Additionally, there was no justification provided for the thresholds assigned to missing population groups, where no transactions were captured in the past 12 months. This could suggest that the initial threshold setting may not have been appropriately calibrated. The absence of transactions makes it difficult to validate whether the threshold settings were effective or appropriate for those groups.

Furthermore, justification or analysis regarding the default value settings and rule scoring is still missing in the updated model documentation. This lack of documentation on the rationale behind these thresholds and scoring further highlights a gap in the transparency and robustness of the model development process.

In conclusion, a clear justification for the appropriateness of these thresholds should be provided. If there was no initial rationale or historical data, or if productive events were not available for certain population groups, a comprehensive assessment of the conceptual soundness should be conducted. This assessment would ensure that these thresholds are effective and aligned with the model's intended purpose. Such analysis is crucial to maintain the integrity of the model and to mitigate the risks associated with arbitrary or unsupported threshold settings.
