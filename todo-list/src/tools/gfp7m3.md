Thank you for the clarification. Here's an updated explanation incorporating the meaning of **BTL (Below the Line)** testing:

### Potential Negative Impact When No Base Population is Generated and No Samples Are Reviewed in BTL Testing

1. **Inability to Validate Model Accuracy and Effectiveness**  
   - BTL testing is designed to test scenarios that fall "below the line" or threshold of triggering alerts. If no base population is generated and no samples are reviewed, the model's ability to capture and assess these lower-risk or borderline cases cannot be validated. This means the modelâ€™s performance in detecting transactions that might fall slightly below the defined thresholds is untested, leaving a significant gap in its accuracy and effectiveness.
   - Without a base population, there's no way to determine whether the model is overly strict (missing real risks) or too lenient (allowing too many borderline cases to pass without further investigation).

2. **Misrepresentation of Risk**  
   - The absence of BTL samples can lead to a misrepresentation of risk, particularly at the thresholds where transactions might not trigger alerts but still pose risk. By not testing these edge cases, the institution may unknowingly allow borderline suspicious activities to slip through the cracks, undermining the model's objective of risk detection.
   - The model may fail to identify trends or behaviors that would only be evident when analyzing "below the line" transactions, potentially leading to an underestimation of financial crime risk, such as money laundering.

3. **Lack of Data to Support Model Adjustments**  
   - BTL testing helps assess whether the thresholds and rules are appropriate and whether they capture risk effectively across all levels of transaction behavior. Without sample data, the model owner (MO) has no empirical foundation for making necessary adjustments to thresholds, recurrence periods, or other scoring parameters.
   - It also limits the ability to fine-tune the model, which could result in thresholds that are either too low (creating unnecessary false positives) or too high (allowing real risks to go undetected).

4. **Increased Regulatory and Compliance Risk**  
   - Regulatory bodies often require comprehensive testing, including BTL testing, to ensure that models are robust and can detect a broad spectrum of risks. A failure to generate and review a sufficient BTL population could lead to gaps in risk coverage, leaving the model non-compliant with regulatory standards.
   - Missing BTL validation could lead to regulatory penalties, sanctions, or forced model redevelopments, which could be costly in both financial and reputational terms.

5. **Failure to Identify Potential Weaknesses**  
   - BTL testing is crucial for identifying weaknesses in the model's thresholds and rules. When no BTL population is generated, it becomes impossible to evaluate if the rules and thresholds are tuned correctly for lower-level risks. This can lead to missed opportunities for improving model performance or identifying potential weaknesses that may later be exploited by malicious actors.
   - Without these insights, the institution may be exposed to hidden risks that would only be revealed through a thorough BTL analysis.

6. **Inability to Justify Changes in Thresholds or Scoring**  
   - Without data from BTL testing, the MO cannot provide a robust justification for adjusting thresholds or scoring. Any proposed changes to the model's settings would be based on theoretical assumptions rather than actual data-driven insights, making it difficult to prove that the model is conceptually sound.
   - This lack of evidence could delay or prevent necessary improvements to the model, further exacerbating its limitations.

7. **Inefficient Model Performance**  
   - By not generating BTL test populations, the institution risks running a model that is not optimized to its fullest potential. The inability to validate or tune "below the line" thresholds can result in inefficient model performance, with either too many false negatives (failing to detect risky transactions) or an excessive number of false positives (flagging too many benign transactions).

In summary, failing to generate a base population and conduct sample reviews in BTL testing can severely impact the model's ability to detect borderline risks, reduce its operational efficiency, and increase regulatory exposure. A lack of BTL validation leaves critical gaps in understanding how the model handles transactions that fall below thresholds, limiting its overall effectiveness in managing risk.



Non-promoted or below-infraction entities may not trigger alert breaks but can still pose significant risks. Without proper testing of these entities, the model might unknowingly allow "less-apparent" suspicious activities to go undetected. As a result, the SBA rule may fail to identify trends or behaviors that are only visible when analyzing non-promoted or below-infraction entities. This oversight can lead to missed opportunities for strengthening the model, ensuring it is robust enough to detect a broad spectrum of risks. Such gaps could later be exploited by bad actors engaging in borderline suspicious activities, thus undermining the effectiveness of the model in risk mitigation.
