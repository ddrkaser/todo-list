The quantitative analysis regarding outliers is insufficient, lacking a business judgment concerning the relevant data selection linked to these outliers. While some quarters were identified as potential outliers, they were not included in the final model development without further clarification. Notably, the final outliers identified by MO exhibit statistical significance, validated by the Rosner test. However, additional outliers also show significance. Some of these outliers were incorporated into the model development due to specific business reasons (e.g., financial crisis and COVID), while justification for the remaining outliers was inadequately provided.

**Direct Impact:** MO has presented a comparison of loss forecasts between the champion model and an alternative model calibrated with additional outliers in [M4, Section 7.1.4.1.], determining the impact as non-material.

**Transparency:** While this issue is non-critical, there exists a clear definition of data outliers in the model documentation, indicating data points with substantial quarterly losses as outliers. MRMC expects further quantitative analysis and business justification.

**Performance Monitoring:** The issue doesn't affect performance monitoring.
