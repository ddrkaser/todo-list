The MO has misunderstood the root cause of the issue. MRMC's concerns are as follows:

1. The MO attempted to justify the appropriateness of the NMMC solely based on the fact that "there was no output impact." However, the MO failed to assess the impact on conceptual soundness (i.e., the appropriateness of the new scoring scales). The original scoring scale has remained unchanged since the initial validation. If it was not based on descriptive data or expert judgment, what was the rationale behind the initial scoring? Why was it considered acceptable in past years but not now? The MO needs to revisit the initial justification and clarify whether the new scoring scale impacts the conceptual soundness.

2. The purpose of this NMMC was to correct the misalignment between two parameters. The MO could not prove that the misalignment of the two parameters was unintentional. There is no evidence showing the existence of such a monitoring gap that may cause potential AML risks due to the misalignment.

The MO should provide the following evidence to address the issue:

1. The rationale for the initial scoring of affected rules.
2. An assessment of the NMMC's impact on the conceptual soundness of the model.
3. Justification for the appropriateness of the new scores and test results that show they are properly tuned.
4. Evidence showing that the misalignment of the two parameters was not intentional and the existence of such a monitoring gap that may cause potential AML risks due to the misalignment.

Without the aforementioned evidence, MRMC is unable to perform a comprehensive assessment of the impact on model risk. Thus, the issue should remain open.
