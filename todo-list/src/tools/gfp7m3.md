Example 2: New Gap Created After 2024 ATL Testing  
The proposed approach of lowering the scoring scale at the rule level to align with the lowest threshold parameter of a specific population group could result in potential misalignment if the lowest threshold is recalibrated during ATL/BTL testing.  

For example, in the March 2024 NMMC, for rule  the scoring scale was reduced from 46,000 to 40,000 to align with the lowest threshold of the population group "INDNSLW3HR." However, in the July 2024 ATL testing, the threshold for this same population group "INDNSLW3HR" was increased to 46,000. This created a new gap, where the lowest threshold is now 46,000, but the scoring scale still starts from 40,000. Please refer to the attached file for more examples of this issue with other rules.

Example 3: The Proposed Approach May Compromise Rule Objectives  
We disagree with the proposed approach of lowering the scoring scale at the rule level to match the lowest threshold parameter of a specific population group. While this approach may close the gap, it compromises the conceptual integrity of the rule objectives and the intended risk coverage.  

For instance, in the rule the minimal transaction amount is set at $5,000 for the population group "IRA3HR," and transactions exceeding $5,000 pose AML risks at the group level. On the other hand, a scoring scale starting from $10,000 implies that transactions above $10,000 represent AML risks at the rule level. This rule is designed to monitor daily excessive fund transfers to detect the risk of structuringâ€”splitting large transfers into smaller ones to avoid regulatory reporting thresholds, typically set at $10,000 by the CTR. MRMC finds that setting the scoring scale at $10,000 effectively suppresses rule breaks where aggregated transactions fall below the $10,000 reporting limit, which is a desirable outcome.

Lowering the scoring scale from $10,000 to $5,000, however, would misalign with the rule's objective and risk coverage.
