We would like to receive confirmation that the feeder models (MMC-11 in 7904 and MMC-4 in 104882) were indeed changed during the recalibration process on SRT risk themes. Additionally, we would like to ensure that the input data before and after the feeder model change have been reconciled. Specifically, we need assurance that there has been no negative impact on the input data as a result of the feeder model change. If there are any observed impacts, we kindly request confirmation that the new feeder models have better data quality.

Good afternoon, I'm contacting you to inquire about the possibility of occasionally working at the Stamford office. I recently relocated to Connecticut because my wife has become a professor at a university in CT. Yesterday, Hardik informed me that Monojit occasionally visits the Stamford office, which has sparked my curiosity about the potential for me to work there on certain occasions. I highly appreciate your time and assistance. Thank you kindly.

MO explained that the model's use case is to assist in conducting targeted marketing efforts aimed at increasing SBL loan utilization and improving the probability of loan repayments. The model generates a list of SL accounts with propensity scores. These scores are calculated based on the likelihood and the expected value of SBL paydowns or new draws in the upcoming month.

MRMC has reviewed the model documentation and supporting materials. If the quality of the model output consistently deteriorates over an extended period, it could result in inaccurate model scores. Ultimately, this could lead to reaching out to many FAs who are unlikely to utilize SL loans. However, this limited impact on UBS reputation is mitigated by the fact that the model is used in conjunction with traditional approaches.

In instances of poor quality forecasts, FAs may provide feedback, which serves as a mechanism for identifying and addressing poor model performance. Given that the model does not feed into any other business applications, MRMC agrees with the model owner's assessment and supports the view that the model's impact is insignificant in this context.
