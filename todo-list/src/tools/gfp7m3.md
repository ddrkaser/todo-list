During MRMC's testing of input data, we observed the presence of outliers. As such, I would like to ask the following:

Does the presence of outliers affect the model's performance?
Aside from the "Model user investigation procedures," are there any other mitigation strategies for these obvious outliers that fall outside the normal range?
