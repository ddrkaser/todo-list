I hope you had a wonderful weekend and welcome back. I approved the RAs last Friday. Now, it's time to address the remediation plan (RPs) and implement compensation controls (CCs). When critical validation issues persist without remediation before the model's use, it is imperative for the model owner to ensure effective compensation controls are in place. These controls act as temporary measures to mitigate model risk until the critical validation issues are resolved. If a model (version) encounters new critical validation issues, a remediation plan must be promptly established. For models in use, this should be done within 2 months of the validation issue publication, while for model versions not yet live, it must be addressed before their go-live, at the latest. Regrettably, we are already falling behind schedule.

Here are the outlined tasks:

1. Review the page that provides background information and guidance on creating RPs within MRMP.
2. Develop your CCs in a separate document, referencing the previous RP available on the MRMP submission & approval tab, as illustrated in the screenshot below.

Correct, soft deletion occurs when incorrect or false positive alerts are generated due to various factors such as system errors, implementation issues, or other anomalies. Monitoring the volume or occurrence of soft deleted alerts provides valuable insights from an implementation perspective. It helps in identifying and understanding instances where alerts were incorrectly generated and subsequently removed, aiding in the assessment of system performance, implementation accuracy, and the overall effectiveness of the alert generation process. Tracking and analyzing these soft deleted alerts contribute to improving the system's accuracy and reducing false positives in the alerting mechanism.
