We would like to receive confirmation that the feeder models (MMC-11 in 7904 and MMC-4 in 104882) were indeed changed during the recalibration process on SRT risk themes. Additionally, we would like to ensure that the input data before and after the feeder model change have been reconciled. Specifically, we need assurance that there has been no negative impact on the input data as a result of the feeder model change. If there are any observed impacts, we kindly request confirmation that the new feeder models have better data quality.

Good afternoon, I'm contacting you to inquire about the possibility of occasionally working at the Stamford office. I recently relocated to Connecticut because my wife has become a professor at a university in CT. Yesterday, Hardik informed me that Monojit occasionally visits the Stamford office, which has sparked my curiosity about the potential for me to work there on certain occasions. I highly appreciate your time and assistance. Thank you kindly.
