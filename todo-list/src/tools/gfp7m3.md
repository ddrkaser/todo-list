I hope you had a wonderful weekend and welcome back. I approved the RAs last Friday. Now, it's time to address the remediation plan (RPs) and implement compensation controls (CCs). When critical validation issues persist without remediation before the model's use, it is imperative for the model owner to ensure effective compensation controls are in place. These controls act as temporary measures to mitigate model risk until the critical validation issues are resolved. If a model (version) encounters new critical validation issues, a remediation plan must be promptly established. For models in use, this should be done within 2 months of the validation issue publication, while for model versions not yet live, it must be addressed before their go-live, at the latest. Regrettably, we are already falling behind schedule.

Here are the outlined tasks:

1. Review the page that provides background information and guidance on creating RPs within MRMP.
2. Develop your CCs in a separate document, referencing the previous RP available on the MRMP submission & approval tab, as illustrated in the screenshot below.

Please inform me if further information is needed. Your time and assistance are greatly appreciated.
