MRMC has reviewed the BTL-24 and identified a discrepancy between the BTL sample review process and the production alert review process. In production, multiple rule breaches are aggregated into a single alert at the party level, which is then reviewed by one individual. However, in the BTL process, samples are taken from the base population and assigned to different reviewers. There have been instances where samples triggered by the same entity within the same month were assigned to five different reviewers. This highlights a divergence between how alerts are handled in testing versus production.
