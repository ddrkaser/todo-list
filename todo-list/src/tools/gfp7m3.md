As you are already aware, the 12915 Revalidation was released on September 19th. You will have a two-month window to submit your remediation action (RA) plan for addressing validation issues. It's important to note that this period is for planning purposes, and actual implementation can be adjusted in the future.

MRMC will review and approve your RAs. Upon approval, you can proceed with the execution of your RAs. For critical validation issues, the deadline for completion is one year after the revalidation, which falls on September 15, 2024. Non-critical issues have a two-year deadline (although they are typically addressed within a year as most MOs prefer). This deadline is set for September 15, 2025.

When submitting your RAs, please provide detailed plans outlining how you intend to resolve the issues. Specificity is key, so avoid vague statements like "MO will fix the issue accordingly." Let's consider validation issue ID 254941 as an example: "MO will design a new KMPI to monitor the inquiry ratio for each rule on a monthly basis..."

Once your RAs are finalized, you can navigate to MRMP, click on the validation issue tab, input your RA plan, and submit it for approval by November 3rd. Please allow us one week for the review and approval process.

If you have any questions or require assistance, please feel free to schedule a meeting with me. I'm here to help you address any RA or MRMP-related concerns. Thank you for your dedication and hard work.
