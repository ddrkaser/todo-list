The BTL testing process lacks transparency and clarity.

MRMC has observed that instead of consolidating all key information in the model document [M1], the BTL testing process is fragmented and documented across multiple files, often containing duplicated or conflicting information.

For instance, the model document [M1] lacks a description of score analysis. Upon inquiry, the Model Owner (MO) informed MRMC that several materials need to be reviewed to understand the score analysis, as outlined below:

1. ﻿﻿﻿[ES-7] UBS CUSO Tuning and Optimization Methodology Document v 1.2.docx - Section 8.2 discusses three possible approaches: evaluating the overall model score that impacts alert generation, analyzing individual score components at the rule level, and conducting a machine learning-based analysis. The MO also mentioned that scoring is determined at both the model and rule-break levels; however, the actual score analysis was conducted at the population group level.

2. ﻿﻿﻿[BM-9] FCP AML TM FSI_BUSA Tuning and Optimization 2024_FINAL.pptx - Slide 2 provides an execution summary; however, the MO failed to explain how the model-level risk appetite was utilized to evaluate the score analysis conducted at the population group level. Additionally, there was no articulation of the results from qualitative analysis and hypothesis testing.

3. ﻿﻿﻿[BM-9] FCP AML TM FSI_BUSA Tuning and Optimization 2024_FINAL.pptx - Appendix B indicates that sampling for score analysis was conducted at the population group level, while the rest of the BTL sampling was conducted at the rule level. Furthermore, the MO did not justify the use of this alternative sampling approach.

4. ﻿﻿﻿[BTL-24] SAM FSI BTL Summary 2024_noCID.xIsx - The tab labeled "Model Level Testing" contains testing results without further explanation.
