For example, the scoring scale for a structuring rule (at the rule level) was initially set from $8,000 to $10,000, assigning a score of 5. Any transaction below $8,000 would receive no score. In this case, we have a population group, IND1, with a minimum threshold of $5,000. This means that a transaction of $6,000 would technically trigger a rule break, yet no score would be assigned. The MO identified this as a gap that needed to be addressed, but we believe this could have been intentional based on the original validation Q&A.

The MO then decided to lower the scoring scale for the entire rule, so that now any transaction between $5,000 and $10,000 would receive a score of 5. We have requested the MO to provide justification for this change in terms of conceptual soundness. Specifically, why is a score of 5 appropriate for a $5,000 transaction related to structuring? Since this adjustment impacts the rule at the fundamental level, it alters both the rule's intended purpose and its coverage. Therefore, a clear rationale is needed to explain the conceptual basis for assigning scores to transactions of this nature.
