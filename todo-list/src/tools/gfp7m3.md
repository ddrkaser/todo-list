In section 5.1.7 of the model documentation, it's noted that "For all interest rate variables the absolute values of first differences are taken since a potential stress scenario can be characterized both by an increase as well as a decrease in interest rate levels". However, the use of absolute differencing in this context does raise some concerns. 

1.The application of absolute differencing to stabilize time series data is uncommon and lacks substantial literature support. Is there any existing research or theoretical work that justify this specific transformation?
2.Economically, the choice of absolute differencing may not align with conventional practices. Typically, first-order differencing captures the direction and magnitude of interest rate changes, which is vital for economic interpretation. Absolute differencing eliminates this directional information and may introduce bias in models, especially in cases where economic conditions can lead to both positive and negative rate changes. In scenarios like economic downturns or booms, the absolute difference of interest rates may not accurately reflect the underlying economic dynamics. This could potentially confuse multivariate regression models and influence coefficient estimates.
3.To address these concerns and evaluate the suitability of absolute differencing compared to more common approaches, please consider the following steps:
 a.Search for relevant literature or theoretical explanations supporting the use of absolute differencing for interest rate time series data. The literature that can support the appropriateness of your approach.
 b.Clearly articulate the economic rationale for favoring absolute differencing over traditional techniques, such as simple differencing or log transformations, in the context of stabilizing time series data. From an economic perspective.
 c.Conduct 3 stationarity tests on the first differences of interest rates and log-transformed interest rates. Let's see what happens.

Please let me know if you need further clarification or assistance with any of these points.
