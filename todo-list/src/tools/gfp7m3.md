If we adopt the proposed scoring scale, and a customer performs two transactions:
1. An unrelated incoming funds transfer totaling $15,000, below the new threshold of $17,250, resulting in a score of 0.
2. An unrelated outgoing funds transfer totaling $15,000, above the new threshold of $11,500, resulting in a score of 5.

The model now produces inconsistent scores within the same transaction typology.
