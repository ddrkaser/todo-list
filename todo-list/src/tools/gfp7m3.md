The revised sampling size calculation lacks capping the COP with the observed ATL productivity rate at the rule/typology level during the BTL test period. Independent testing revealed that for 4 rules, the hypothesis test was inaccurately structured, as the COP or ERoR assumptions used in the sample size estimation exceeded the ATL productivity rate. Furthermore, the productivity rates for the Excessive Funds Transfers rule and Structuring Activity rule typologies were inaccurately calculated

The threshold values were significantly reduced for BTL testing due to limited activity and low transaction values within specific population groups. For this purpose, when dropping the threshold value by 15% for population groups where the dropped threshold value was at or below the 100th percentile in the distribution of relevant transactions for each rule. However, in cases where the 15% dropped threshold value was above the 100th percentile in the transaction distribution, the threshold was reduced to the median value.

Nevertheless, in certain population groups, there was a constraint due to limited transaction activity and extremely low transaction values. Consequently, the median value fell below $100, highlighting the challenge posed by these exceptionally low-value transactions within those specific groups.
