The revised sampling size calculation lacks capping the COP with the observed ATL productivity rate at the rule/typology level during the BTL test period. Independent testing revealed that for 4 rules, the hypothesis test was inaccurately structured, as the COP or ERoR assumptions used in the sample size estimation exceeded the ATL productivity rate. Furthermore, the productivity rates for the Excessive Funds Transfers rule and Structuring Activity rule typologies were inaccurately calculated.

There's also an absence of justification from the MO regarding assumptions of a linear relationship between ERoR and MoE, including the identification of slope and intercept. Additionally, during independent testing, it was observed that these parameters are set based on the total sample size required to perform the assessment.
