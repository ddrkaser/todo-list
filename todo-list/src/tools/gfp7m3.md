According to MM-11, the lesser value of MAD and the production threshold was used as the baseline. However, for the PRJ-STR-CKS rules, a baseline of $5,000 is applied, aligning with the rule’s intent as per FCP. MRMC requests additional justification regarding the following three thresholds:

Baseline Threshold ($5,000):
This MAD is calculated based on transactions of the rule "PRJ-STR-CKS-INN-A-S01-SST," aligning with the rule's intent. Why is it appropriate to use this same baseline for the rule "PRJ-STR-CKS-OUT-A-S01-SST," given that it exhibits a different transaction distribution?

Final Threshold ($8,000):
FCP recommends setting the lower bound threshold at $8,000, which is stated to align with the rule's intent. This recommendation is confusing, as $5,000 is also described as aligning with the same intent. Can you provide a stronger justification as to why $8,000 is more suitable than $5,000? Specifically:

Why was $8,000 chosen as the lower bound?
Are there statistical analyses or patterns observed by FCP regarding structuring activities that substantiate this decision?
Without such evidence, one might argue that $7,000 or $9,000 could be equally, if not more, appropriate. Please clarify.
Production Threshold ($1,000):
This threshold was deemed not conceptually tunable during the 2023 and 2024 revalidations, as indicated in the parameter selection spreadsheet. Since this threshold is a user-defined value (the default being $8,000), alignment with the rule's intent should have been considered when FCP or M&M initially set this value. Why is this threshold now considered misaligned with the rule’s intent, despite being aligned in the past?

Missed Productive Entity (AML-R Rule):
There is one productive entity missed by this rule, while AML-R captures an extra immaterial entity. Can you provide a more detailed materiality assessment of the missed entity? Specifically:

If the entity were escalated due to structuring, the rule would fail to capture a material entity.
This would result in AML-R capturing an additional immaterial entity.
Please elaborate on the implications of this discrepancy.
