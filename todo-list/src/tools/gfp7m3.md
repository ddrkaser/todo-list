However, the CRR scores may not align with the client risk ratings after overrides. The model generates a rating for clients derived from a set of predefined subfactors that impact money laundering risk. These subfactors can be categorized as overriding (e.g., Global PEP), minimum overriding (Local PEP and Adverse Media), and non-overriding (e.g., Occupation). The rating for a given client can be determined using the following approaches:

1. If no hit for overriding subfactors is observed, the risk rating is obtained as the sum of scores of each non-overriding subfactor.
2. If a hit for either of the two minimum overriding subfactors is observed, the risk rating is obtained as the sum of scores of each non-overriding subfactor. However, this rating is overridden based on minimum risk applicability.
3. If a hit for one of the overriding subfactors is observed, the risk rating is obtained as the sum of scores of each non-overriding subfactor. Although redundant, the overall risk is overridden to "Higher" for the client.

As noted in bullet points 2 and 3, in some cases, the final risk rating obtained for a given client could differ from the risk score calculated as the product of the non-overriding subfactor hits observed. The discrepancy in the risk rating for the client based on calculated scores using non-overriding subfactors versus those adjusted using overriding subfactors is the basis of this issue. Therefore, issue 1 remains unresolved.
