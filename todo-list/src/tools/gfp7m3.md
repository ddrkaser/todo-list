In accordance with the Inherent Risk Rating guideline (1-G-007820), the Inherent Risk Rating (IRR) for CUSO MGCs is assessed based on both materiality and complexity. The materiality rating considers the use reliance rating and exposure rating, while the complexity rating considers inputs, methodology, and implementation.

1. The use reliance is deemed non-critical, as the model's output does not directly lead to regulatory filings and does not have a significant operational or business impact on the firm.

2. The exposure is evaluated as high, consistent with the default exposure ratings for Monitoring & Surveillance models (refer to Table 5 in Annex 2.2.3 of 1-G-007820). The model falls under the category of 'Other models with application scope not limited to a single country or representing the entirety of the MGC's scope.'

3. Consequently, the overall materiality is assessed as medium.

4. Initially rated as low, the default complexity is adjusted to medium following overrides. This adjustment considers various factors such as model inputs, number of components, methodology for model estimation, potential uncertainty of model recalibration outcome, and implementation.

4a. The inputs are rated as medium, indicated by several factors: The current model version requires manageable data volumes handled by standard tools. The data, sourced from Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), Report Delivery System (RDS), and Actimize, is readily available and structured with minimal uncertainty. However, the model relies on multiple quality controls of input data (e.g., ABC checking process, RDS exception handling by EDW/RDS teams) to ensure accuracy and completeness of key attributes and to address any issues before model execution. Although data load testing is conducted, the input data's granularity, dependent on upstream source systems, may introduce uncertainty due to intermingling of various data sources and components.

4b. The methodology is rated as low, as the model employs a simple rules-based approach to monitoring.

4c. The implementation is rated as low, as the model is implemented using standard UBS IT protocols.

Considering the above rationale, MRMC finds the Model Owner's assessment reasonable, except for the input complexity, which should be rated as medium due to the factors mentioned. Consequently, the IRR for CUSO is rated as medium.
