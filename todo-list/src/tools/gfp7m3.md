The quantitative analysis on outliers is inadequate, lacking a business judgment on the data quality pertaining to these outliers. While some quarters were pinpointed as potential outliers, they were not integrated into the final model development without additional clarification. It's worth noting that the final outliers identified by MO exhibit statistical significance, as confirmed by the Rosner test. However, there exist additional outliers that hold significance. Among them, certain outliers were employed in the model development due to specific business rationale (e.g., financial crisis and COVID), yet justification for the remaining outliers was not sufficiently provided.
