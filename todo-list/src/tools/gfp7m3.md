BM-9 mentions that each rule was assessed at the population group level, but the threshold decisions have not consistently reflected this. As noted, for the rule "AML-AML-AML," thresholds were uniformly increased by 15% across all population groups, regardless of the distribution behavior at the individual population group level.

For those population groups where the production threshold is already at a high value (at the 100th percentile), increasing the threshold further will not enhance the model's efficiency in terms of reducing false positive alerts. During a regulatory inspection in August 2023, the regulator identified deficiencies, noting that "procedures and processes were not sufficiently tailored to capture and provide insights for the population of affected customers, nor were criteria established for testing during model performance monitoring and tuning." The decision to increase thresholds for some population groups appears to take a holistic approach, which conflicts with the regulator's finding that adjustments should be specifically tailored to the population of affected customers.

Could you explain how the assessments at the population group level have been reconciled with these rule-level decisions?
