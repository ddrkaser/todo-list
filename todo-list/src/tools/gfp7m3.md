There are multiple versions of sample size estimation documents. For instance, [T-3] was last updated on March 13, 2022, while [T-8] makes reference to "the sample size calculator documentation found within the folder." I've identified two issues:

1. I encountered difficulty in locating the file within the folder.

2. [T-3] appears to be outdated. [T-6] and [T-7] suggest that the SAM FS employs the same sample size calculation method as SAM CB, yet I have been unable to locate any documentation confirming this. Could you please provide additional documentation regarding how the calculation is performed in files [T-6] and [T-7]?
