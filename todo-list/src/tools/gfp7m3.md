Review of MRMC:

The Model Owner has incorporated Section 6.5 #4, introducing the monthly dashboard for alerts and the "soft deletion" process.
On a monthly basis, the Model Owner conducts a comprehensive check using a dashboard, offering insights into issues such as alert generation anomalies due to data load errors, incorrect classification of country codes, or delays in receiving counterparty information. In the event of such situations, the Model Owner initiates the "soft-deletion of alerts" process.
If any discrepancies are pinpointed by M&M, FCP-IT/FCP will be notified to identify the root cause. Incorrect or false-positive alerts will be segregated and subject to soft-deletion pending FCP's approval. These soft-deleted alerts will remain invisible in the front end.

Conclusion of MRMC:

MRMC has evaluated the updated "soft deletion" process, delineating procedures and criteria specifying the qualifications for alerts eligible for "soft deletion" and the responsible parties in this process. Consequently,
MRMC considers that this issue can be closed.
