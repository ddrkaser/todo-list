MRMC considers all regulatory red flags within the model's scope, unless there is substantiated evidence demonstrating that specific regulatory requirements are addressed by processes or tools external to the model. The provided documentation establishes links between red flags, risk typologies, and scenarios. In cases where a comprehensive and transparent mapping between relevant red flags and active scenarios within the model is absent, MRMC sought to deduce this information through an indirect path: first, from red flags to risk typologies, and then from risk typologies to scenarios.

To evaluate whether the scenarios adequately encompass regulatory red flags, MRMC conducted a review of the mapping of scenarios to typologies, as provided by the model owner. Upon assessing the coverage analysis presented in the CB - US Red Flag Guidance[M19], which details the correspondence between red flags and scenarios, MRMC has observed a deficiency. Notably, the guidance does not address the mapping of red flags to newly introduced Shell company scenarios. Consequently, MRMC has raised an issue highlighting a coverage gap in the assessment, particularly concerning the mapping of Shell company scenarios.
