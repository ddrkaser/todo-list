A qualitative explanation is indeed necessary to justify why the thresholds and scores meet the intended objectives of the FCP (Financial Crime Prevention) rules. Since a risk-based approach is being utilized, the underlying risks that drive the choice of new thresholds and scores must be thoroughly documented. This is essential so that any third party, regulator, or future FCP officer can understand the rationale behind these decisions.

For instance, if a new FCP officer reviews the thresholds and scores tomorrow, they should be able to easily grasp why FCP chose those specific thresholds and scores. Take, for example, the comparison of a $10K threshold versus a $12K threshold. If you state that the difference is a result of a gap, how can it be confirmed that the previous FCP officer had not intentionally set the threshold at $12K? Without a qualitative explanation from FCP, the rationale behind choosing either threshold—whether it’s $10K or $12K—remains unclear.

Now, assuming that the difference was truly a gap, another question arises: why was the score for the $10K–$12K range set at 5, rather than 20, which is the score between $12K and $15K? This decision needs to be explained by FCP. This question is especially pertinent considering that both BTL (Below-the-Line) testing under the different thresholds and scores did not result in material changes to the model’s output. Therefore, why is the new threshold and score more appropriate than the old one? Once again, a qualitative explanation from FCP is essential, so that in the future, if a similar change is made and a different FCP officer is in charge, they can clearly understand the rationale behind the current decision.

Hypothetically, lowering the threshold from $12K to $10K and assigning a score of 5 could have potentially increased false positives. FCP’s qualitative assessment should articulate the thought process behind deciding on the revised threshold and score. Were the potential risks of increasing false positives considered? How was the decision weighed against the objective of the model to detect meaningful risk events while minimizing false alerts?

It’s also important to keep in mind SR 11-7, which states that the model must be accurate and that conservatism should only be introduced when model weaknesses have been identified. Margins of conservatism cannot be arbitrarily applied without first confirming that there are actual weaknesses in the model. In this context, FCP needs to explain why the new thresholds and scores are more aligned with the model’s objectives, and how the decisions were made in light of any potential weaknesses.

In conclusion, detailed documentation that provides qualitative explanations for the threshold and score changes is critical, not only for internal review but also for ensuring that regulators and future decision-makers can follow the rationale behind these key adjustments.
