MRMC has reviewed the evidence [M62] submitted by the MO regarding the use of overriding subfactors and confirms the following:

1. Alternative measures to accurately apply minimum risk ratings to a client were discussed adequately, justifying the use of CRR overriding factors.
2. No gaps were identified by the SMEs in the model output review assessment, as shown in analysis 13.
3. The rule makes the model outputs more conservative.
4. However, the CRR scores may not align with the client risk ratings after overrides. In some cases, the final risk rating obtained for a given client could differ from the risk score calculated as the product of the non-overriding subfactor hits observed. The discrepancy in the risk rating for the client based on calculated scores using non-overriding subfactors versus those adjusted using overriding subfactors is the basis of this issue. Therefore, issue 1 remains unresolved.

In addition to the update for the inclusion of overriding risk factors, the assumption pertaining to "the weights of risk factors and sub-risk factors, applicability rules, thresholds, overrides that go into the calculation are appropriately chosen based on the SME's knowledge and assessment" will remain applicable, and continued regular SME backtests will be required to monitor model performance. MRMC agrees with the use of overriding subfactors in generating CRR, and hence no remediation action besides a continued regular SME backtest to monitor model performance is required.

To consider this issue remediated, MRMC recommends the MO to update assumption 1 to include that money laundering risk associated with clients is adequately represented with the use of subfactors overriding risk ratings in cases where minimum risk ratings required by group or local policy requirements are to be applied.
