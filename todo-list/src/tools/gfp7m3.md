Certainly. The absence of a reference table for calculating the overall complexity rating means that the guideline does not provide a specific numerical or formulaic approach to determine the complexity rating. Instead, it relies on the expertise and judgment of the model owner to assess the model's complexity based on the guidance provided and the complexity indicators relevant to the specific model.

This approach acknowledges the diverse nature of financial models and the varying factors that contribute to their complexity. Models can differ significantly in terms of inputs, methodology, implementation, and other factors, making it challenging to create a one-size-fits-all reference table. Therefore, the guideline empowers the model owner to consider all relevant factors and make a holistic judgment on the model's complexity level.

While this approach may require more subjective assessment, it allows for a more nuanced evaluation that takes into account the unique characteristics and context of each model. It encourages thorough consideration of all relevant complexities and uncertainties, ultimately leading to a more accurate assessment of the model's overall complexity and its associated risks.
