1. The use reliance for the CUSO MGC entity is deemed critical due to the model's regulatory usage and its significant operational and business impact. The model is employed to generate automated alerts concerning potential money laundering and terrorist financing activities among the Stamford Branch CB clients in the United States. These alerts are integral to mitigating the inherent money laundering and terrorist financing risks within UBS's overall risk profile and ensuring compliance with Anti Money Laundering (AML) regulatory requirements. The operational impact of the model encompasses potential financial loss, foregone revenue, material misstatement of disclosures, and regulatory fines.

2. The exposure is rated as high, as the application scope extends beyond a single country and encompasses the entirety of the MGC's scope.

3. Consequently, the overall materiality for the CUSO MGC is assessed as high.

4. The overall complexity is rated as medium, taking into account various factors including model inputs, number of model components, methodology for model estimation, potential uncertainty of model recalibration outcome, and implementation.

a. The inputs are rated as medium, as indicated by several factors:
   i. Data sourced from numerous data sources (more than 3 data sources).
   ii. Handling of very large volumes of data requiring non-standard data handling tools (six static data sources are manual feeds and updated ad-hoc as changes are communicated by the data owners to the MO).
   iii. Use of data proxies for missing data substitution.
   iv. Incorporation of unstructured data from several input sources with large volumes of unstructured data processed through multiple layers of detection for AML patterns using complex algorithms.
   v. Inclusion of data sources that may pose a conduct risk or conflict of interest (e.g., confidential personal data).
   vi. However, the input risk is mitigated by the assurance that standard internal or industry data sources are known to be of high quality and well-controlled.

b. The methodology is rated as medium based on the following indicators:
   i. Utilization of complex theory involving high-level statistical or mathematical techniques (several layers of detection logic filtering through transactions for money laundering patterns/typologies).
   ii. Incorporation of a large number of assumptions and limitations (more than 20) to which the model output is highly sensitive.
   iii. However, the methodology risk is mitigated by the fact that the model is based on a well-established modeling approach documented in literature and established as an industry standard. Hence, the metric is rated as medium.

c. The implementation is rated as high considering the following indicators:
   i. Involvement of a very complex UBS IT infrastructure (implementation entails several layers of ETL with staged data from input data sources, and derivation logic of some fields directly impacting the model detection logic as key data elements).
   ii. However, despite the complexity, the model is implemented using straightforward/standard UBS IT protocols. Additionally, the model deployment adheres to established UBS software development protocols/standards, mitigating implementation risk.

Therefore, MRMC deems the Model Owner's assessment reasonable, and the IRR for CUSO is rated as high.
