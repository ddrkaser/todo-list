The figure illustrates that the majority of rules exhibit a correlation of under 0.5, with the exception of PRJ-FTF-ALL-ALL-P-B02-FTI (Flow Through of Funds (Party Group Level)-2 days) and PRJ-FTF-ALL-ALL-P-B14-FTI (Flow Through of Funds (Party Group Level)-14 days). Upon conducting an in-depth analysis, MRMC has determined that both of these rules fall under the "Flow Through of Funds" typology, as outlined in Section 4.7 of the Model Documentation [bib:modeldocl]. The high correlation between these rule pairs can be attributed to their shared focus on monitoring transactional patterns, albeit within different time windows (2 days and 14 days).

MRMC also notes that following the 2022 BTL remediation exercise, it was observed that there is an 80% overlap in the alerts generated by the rules PRJ-FTF-ALL-ALL-P-B02-FTI and PRJ-FTF-ALL-ALL-P-B14-FTI. Despite the key distinction being the detection time period (2 days versus 14 days), subject matter experts (SMEs) were involved in assessing and finalizing the rule and typology coverage. Additionally, the decision to keep both rules active in the SAM FS model stems from concerns that decommissioning PRJ-FTF-ALL-ALL-P-B02-FTI could expose the bank to additional risks associated with the 20% of alerts that do not overlap with the other rule.

Regarding the rest of the rules, their low correlation indicates that they are less redundant and effectively distinguish between transactional patterns monitored by these designated rules. MRMC finds that the model complexity aligns with the model owner's requirements.
