To assess whether the scenarios comprehensively encompass regulatory red flags, MRMC conducted a thorough examination of the mapping of scenarios to typologies, as supplied by the model owner. During the evaluation of the coverage analysis presented in the CB - US Red Flag Guidance [M23], which outlines the relationship between red flags and scenarios, MRMC identified a deficiency. Notably, the guidance did not address the mapping of red flags to newly introduced Shell company scenarios.

Upon request, the model owner supplied additional evidence pertaining to Shell company scenarios in SAM CB _Rule to typology mapping_v1.2 [M77]. This document provided substantiated coverage of Shell company scenarios. Consequently, MRMC raised Issue 7, emphasizing a gap in the model documentation submitted, particularly concerning the assessment of coverage for Shell company scenarios.

MRMC has conducted an assessment and determined that the detection rule and Security Blanket rule logic align with the rule intents and scenarios. However, MRMC has observed that despite the model owner providing additional documentation that addresses rule coverage for the newly introduced Shell company scenario, the submitted model documentation does not include the rule sheet specific to Shell company scenarios. Consequently, MRMC has cited Issue 7, underscoring a gap in the model documentation concerning the coverage of Shell company scenarios.
