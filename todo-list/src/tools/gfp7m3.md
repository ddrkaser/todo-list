MRMC has thoroughly reviewed the evidence provided by MO and [MM-5] Rule Sheets and has made the following observations:

1. During the model development and optimization processes, certain rule-threshold parameters (such as minimal sum) were customized to meet AML requirements or specific population groups. However, there is a lack of articulation regarding the appropriateness of these threshold parameters. In issue 5, which addresses gaps and insufficient rationale around parameter selection for Detection Rules, MRMC notes inconsistencies in selected thresholds across different population groups, a lack of justification for some thresholds in missing population groups, and instances where current thresholds fail to capture suspicious activities for certain groups. For example, according to [MM-5] Rule Sheets, no activity was found in the population group "IRA3HR" where the minimal sum is set at $5,000 for rule PRJ-EFT-ACH-INN-A-D01-EAT.

2. Although corresponding scoring scale parameters are adjustable, no statistical tests were conducted on the scoring scale during previous BTL tests. In issue 6, which addresses the robustness of calibration, MRMC highlights the absence of a sufficiently robust evaluation of all model settings and thresholds to ensure alignment with UBS's specific risk profile and appetite. MRMC emphasizes the need to test and justify all tunable components, including rules, thresholds, and scoring parameters, to ensure the model functions as intended. For instance, for rule PRI-EFT-ACH-INN-A-D01-EAT, the scoring scale assigns a score of 5 to transaction amounts ranging from $10,000 to $30,000, but MO did not provide validation for this range and score.

3. MRMC acknowledges the identification of misalignments in certain rules where the scoring scale does not start at the rule threshold value. This results in observed rule breaks without allocation to an alert, creating unintended monitoring gaps. However, MRMC disagrees with the proposed approach of lowering the scoring scale on a rule level to align with the lowest threshold parameter of a particular population group. This approach, although closing the gap, compromises the conceptual soundness of rule objectives and risk coverage. MRMC emphasizes that rule-threshold parameters aim to prevent rule breaks for transactions of negligible amounts, while scoring scale parameters represent the level of risk a pattern poses. Setting the scoring scale starting from $10,000 for rule PRJ-EFT-ACH-INN-A-D01-EAT effectively suppresses rule breaks with aggregated transaction amounts below the $10,000 reporting limit, which is desirable.

Conclusion:

MRMC recognizes the need to address the monitoring gap but finds that extending the lower bound of the scoring scale fails to enhance risk coverage and lacks qualitative and quantitative support. The root cause of the monitoring gap lies in the exclusion of scoring scale parameters from periodic optimization and inadequate fine-tuning and testing of rule-threshold parameters during optimization. Although the lack of sufficient justification hinders MRMC's assessment of conceptual soundness, in some instances, the current settings may lead to desirable outcomes.

Regarding scoring scale adjustments, MRMC suggests basing range value adjustments on statistical and conceptual analyses, refining values based on rule coverage and historical productivity, generating additional alert breaks using the refined values, and testing the productivity of the settings. Alert volume, true positive rate, and the positions of productive alerts should also be considered during these tests.

Conclusion:

MRMC understands the imperative to close the monitoring gap; however, the extension of the lower bound of the scoring scale failed to provide additional risk coverage and lacked support of qualitative and quantitative analysis. The root cause of the monitoring gap is more than the misalignment between rule-threshold parameters and scoring scale parameters; it is the combined result of the exclusion of scoring scale parameters from periodic optimization and inadequate fine-tuning and testing of rule-threshold parameters during periodic optimization. Although the lack of sufficient justification of these parameters hinders MRMC's assessment of conceptual soundness, in some instances, the current settings may lead to a desirable outcome.

Regarding scoring scale adjustments, MRMC suggests that the adjustment of the range values should be based on statistical and conceptual analyses, refining the values based on rule coverage and historical productivity, generating additional alert breaks using the refined values, and testing the productivity of the setting to determine any additional adjustments needed in production. The alert volume and true positive rate as well as the positions of productive alerts should also be looked at during these tests.

MRMC recognizes that certain rules exhibit misalignments where the scoring scale does not commence at the rule threshold value. Consequently, despite detecting a rule break (i.e., an AML relevant pattern), no contribution to an alert would be allotted, resulting in an unintended monitoring gap. However, MRMC disagrees with the proposed approach of lowering the scoring scale on the rule level to synchronize with the lowest threshold parameter of a specific population group. This suggested approach, although capable of closing the gap, compromises the conceptual integrity of rule objectives and their risk coverage, leading to a substantial model change for the following reasons:

1. Rule-threshold parameters, such as the minimal sum, primarily function to prevent the generation of rule breaks for transactions of negligible amounts that are not deemed worthy of investigation. It is believed that criminals are unlikely to launder such small amounts of money, and even if they do, they pose a minimal threat to the financial system.

2. Scoring scale parameters are intended to represent the level of risk associated with a particular pattern. A higher score indicates a higher risk level. This risk assessment guides the decision-making process on whether the detected activity should be presented to an analyst as an alert or disregarded.

3. Taking the example of rule PRJ-EFT-ACH-INN-A-D01-EAT, where the minimal sum is set at $5,000 for the population group "IRA3HR," transactions above $5,000 would warrant AML risks on the group level. Conversely, a scoring scale starting from $10,000 implies that transactions above $10,000 indicate AML risks on the rule level. This rule is designated to monitor daily excessive fund transfer activity to detect the risk of splitting a large transfer into several smaller transfers to evade regulatory reporting limits, typically set at $10,000 as required by CTR. MRMC finds that setting the scoring scale starting from $10,000 effectively suppresses the particular rule break with aggregated transaction amounts below the $10,000 reporting limit, resulting in a desirable outcome. Similar scenarios are also observed in NFRI Issue - 20584, where certain rules exhibit setups where the scoring scale does not align with the rule threshold value, effectively suppressing rule breaks. In some cases, this behavior may be desired for rule or rule break scoring.

4. In [SG01) ES SCORING ANALYSIS Updated, a retrospective analysis conducted by MO on the 12 affected rules aimed to identify any significant alerts missed due to the scoring gap from February 2021 to January 2024. However, no additional alert breaks were found in the gap, indicating that the extended scoring scale would not capture any additional AML risks.

In conclusion, while MRMC acknowledges the need to address monitoring gaps, it maintains that adjusting the scoring scale's lower bound fails to enhance risk coverage and lacks support from qualitative and quantitative analysis. The root cause of the monitoring gap extends beyond the misalignment between rule-threshold parameters and scoring scale parameters, encompassing the exclusion of scoring scale parameters from periodic optimization and inadequate fine-tuning and testing of rule-threshold parameters during optimization. Although the lack of sufficient justification for these parameters impedes MRMC's assessment of conceptual soundness, in some instances, the current settings may yield desirable outcomes. MRMC suggests basing adjustments to range values of the scoring scale on statistical and conceptual analyses, refining values based on rule coverage and historical productivity, and testing the productivity of the setting to determine any necessary additional adjustments in production. Additionally, analyzing alert volume, true positive rate, and the positions of productive alerts during these tests is recommended.
