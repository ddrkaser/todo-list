The risks identified by MRMC are as follows:

1. The model documentation fails to provide explanations for all lists included in the DSL configuration file. This includes lists such as Empty  and no longer used lists like . Additionally, although SSI keywords are deactivated, they still exist in the system. Despite being mentioned as not in use in sections 2.5, 7.6, and 9.8 of the model document, functions listed for SSI keywords (BASKET_SSI_TF, BASKET_SSI) in the DSL/DSR configuration file raise uncertainty about their deactivation status. This ambiguity poses a potential future risk of auto-populating these lists due to their empty placeholders, even if currently unused.

2. The model documentation lacks sufficient details regarding each configuration file's purpose, importance, storage location, change history, and handling procedures. This deficiency in information transparency, although not expected to directly impact the model output or usage, highlights the need for updating the documentation to ensure complete transparency.

Direct Impact: The identified gaps primarily concern updating the model documentation and are not anticipated to directly influence the model's output or usage.

Transparency: While the information is available, it lacks adequate detail. Although this shortfall may not impede understanding the basics of model validation, it is imperative to enhance the information for full transparency.
