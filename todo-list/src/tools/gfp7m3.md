Direct Impact: Following the review of available information, the current gaps identified in the MPMC concept are not anticipated to significantly affect the model outputs or its usage.

Transparency: There is a need to enhance documentation to facilitate third-party understanding of the various components of model risk. Currently, information is dispersed across multiple versions of references, necessitating collation for easier interpretation.

Performance Monitoring: The confirmation results submitted suggest that the model risk has not markedly increased over the last confirmation cycle. However, according to MRMC, this assertion lacks full evidence, and additional clarifications on the confirmation assessments or results are necessary.
