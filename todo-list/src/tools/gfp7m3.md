Certainly! The main issue highlighted in the previous conversation is the misalignment between rule-threshold parameters and scoring scale parameters in the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) model. This misalignment leads to an unintended monitoring gap where certain rule breaks are not flagged for further investigation, despite being potentially indicative of suspicious activity. While there is recognition of this issue, there is disagreement regarding the proposed solution of adjusting the scoring scale to align with the lowest threshold parameter of specific population groups. The disagreement stems from concerns about the conceptual integrity of the model's objectives and risk coverage. Additionally, there is a lack of sufficient justification and support for this proposed solution, as well as the need for comprehensive evaluation and optimization of all model settings and thresholds.

Certainly! The disagreement regarding the proposed solution revolves around the adjustment of the scoring scale to align with the lowest threshold parameter of specific population groups. Here's a breakdown of the disagreement:

1. **Conceptual Integrity and Risk Coverage:** MRMC disagrees with the proposed approach because it believes that aligning the scoring scale with the lowest threshold parameter of a population group compromises the conceptual integrity of the model's objectives and its risk coverage. This alignment may lead to unintended consequences and could potentially overlook certain suspicious activities.

2. **Purpose of Rule-Threshold Parameters and Scoring Scale Parameters:** There's a fundamental difference in the purpose of rule-threshold parameters and scoring scale parameters. Rule-threshold parameters, such as minimal sums, are intended to prevent the generation of rule breaks for transactions of negligible amounts that are not deemed worthy of investigation. On the other hand, scoring scale parameters are meant to represent the level of risk associated with a particular pattern. Adjusting the scoring scale to align with threshold parameters may blur this distinction and lead to a misinterpretation of risk levels.

3. **Effectiveness of the Proposed Solution:** While the proposed approach may close the monitoring gap by ensuring that all rule breaks are flagged for investigation, MRMC questions its effectiveness in achieving the desired outcome. There are concerns that this approach may not adequately capture all relevant suspicious activities and could result in unnecessary alerts or false positives, leading to operational inefficiencies.

Overall, MRMC believes that a more comprehensive and nuanced approach is needed to address the monitoring gap, one that considers the broader implications on model performance, risk assessment, and operational effectiveness.
