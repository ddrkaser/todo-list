Here is the refined version of MRMC's assessment outcome:

1. MRMC has thoroughly evaluated the proposed approach to aggregating results from both UBS and CS on a comparable level and has determined that the model methodology is broadly suitable based on the assessment of the conceptual framework. Additionally, MRMC has scrutinized the rationale behind the methodology, ensuring that although the two regression model approaches differ, the methodologies for loss projection are reasonably equivalent across the entities. This similarity allows for a direct aggregation approach for regression model results. MRMC emphasizes that the results from both entities were obtained using validated methodologies, thus warranting trust in their accuracy.

2. Regarding the adjustment of scenario add-ons, MRMC acknowledges that scenarios were carefully reviewed and endorsed by each entity's subject matter experts (SMEs), aligning with specific scenarios based on forward-looking risks. Adjustments are necessary to address the duplication of risks across UBS and CS scenarios, accounting for additional risks that may emerge due to integration. Furthermore, MRMC confirms that adjustments for overlap are applicable only to the internal severely adverse scenario, as the idiosyncratic add-on is excluded in the Fed severely adverse case.
