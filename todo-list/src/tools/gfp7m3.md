The issues pertaining to the model forecasts are as follows:

**Open Issues:**
1. **Scenario Separation:** The regression-based risk theme displays highly understressed model forecasts with no clear differentiation between the baseline and stress cases.
2. **Model Accuracy:** Goodness-of-fit tests and residual diagnostics indicate that the model solely captures extreme losses, identified as outliers, and fails to capture loss variability when these events are excluded.
3. **Predictive Power and Coefficient Signs:** The independent variables lack predictive power. Additionally, some regressions exhibit coefficient signs contrary to those observed in the correlation analysis.

**Closed Issues:**
1. **Alternate Models:** The documentation lacks clarity regarding alternate models excluding outliers, specifically in terms of the independent variables used and the statistical validity of these alternatives.

**Newly Opened Issue:**
1. **SME Insights and Model Adjustments:** Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) play a critical role due to the model's high complexity and uncertainty. However, they lack information about uncertainties and limitations in the loss projections. MRMC identifies significant weaknesses, including the inclusion/exclusion of extreme events from final projections and adjustments of QLM based on idiosyncratic model outputs. These weaknesses are crucial when considering adjustments to the projections.

Concerning bulletpoint 1, the scenario separation remains inadequate between the baseline and stress cases in the current validation cycle. Specifically, in FNR 15.1, the forecasted loss ratio between the baseline and binding scenarios is nearly 1, while ratios in other NFRs are also less than double, indicating a lack of significant scenario separation between baseline and stress cases.

Regarding bulletpoint 2, improvements have been made in the goodness-of-fit test results, effectively addressing this concern.

Regarding bulletpoint 3, there's been an enhancement in predictive power for some NFRs, effectively addressing this issue. However, MRMC suggests restricting the model use for NFR 2.1, NFR 2.2, NFR 2.3, NFR 4.1, and NFR 15.1, favoring the implementation of a fallback approach as more appropriate.

As for bulletpoint 4, alternate models without outliers lack clear details concerning the independent variables used. Additionally, the champion model is calibrated with outliers without a clear explanation for retaining them post-identification. Equations 3.9 and 3.10 require more elaboration, as equation 3.9 uses the total number of quarters instead of the count of dummy quarters in the denominator, possibly affecting the expected dummy loss calculation. Moreover, adding expected dummy loss to both baseline and binding scenarios in equation 3.10 might lead to an overestimation for baseline and an underestimation for the binding scenario. The impact of this add-on expected dummy loss to the final loss forecast should undergo thorough testing.

Regarding bulletpoint 5, for some NFRs (2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 15.1) where correlations between selected macroeconomic variables and predicted variables are weak, the rationale for SME-recommended variables lacks robust support for variable selection and business rationale. Additional feedback from SMEs on the final champion model is essential to comprehensively grasp the linkage between economic variables and risk themes.
