Hi Jamie,

Sorry to interrupt you. I just wanted to reach out and apologize if it seemed earlier that I wasn't on your side. I'm sorry for making you feel that way. I want to assure you that I wasn't trying to lead you in any particular direction. We only discovered these gaps after receiving the base population on Monday, and we spent hours in internal discussions to ensure we asked the appropriate and legitimate questions in today's meeting. I couldn't present all our findings at once, so the questions were sequential, corresponding to the timeline of how we uncovered these gaps. I didn’t mean to come across as pushy or compelling, and I apologize if that’s how it felt.

In the upcoming Q&A session, I suggest we start by listing our findings at the beginning of the meeting and then dive into the details. Please let me know your thoughts. I really appreciate your time and help in addressing our questions during the revalidation.
