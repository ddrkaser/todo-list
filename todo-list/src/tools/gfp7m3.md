Regarding issue description points 1, 2, and 6, MRMC has reviewed the Parameter Analysis document in [MM-5] RuleSheets [027] and the Optimization Tuning Methodology document ES-7 Optimization Methodology [4]. This review includes examples of how the results from each statistical test are utilized to determine the statistical soundness for BTL tunability. Therefore, these bullet points have been completely addressed.

For issue description point 2, the MO has provided additional justification. The statistics generated for parameters at a population group level for the specific time period (April 2022 to March 2023 for the latest BTL execution) clarify that a missing value (NaN) indicates no relevant transaction activity for that rule within the considered population group and time frame. MRMC considers this missing value issue to be completely addressed.

Moreover, concerning issue description point 6, the MO has given additional details on utilizing maximum values for population groups. The parameter value distribution is derived from every transaction of the relevant transaction type for the rule without applying any filtering logic. For determining BTL testing thresholds, the maximum value of the parameter distribution isn't used. Only the median value might be employed where applicable, following the process indicated in Section 5.3.2 of the Optimization Tuning Methodology document ES-7. Thus, this bullet point has been completely addressed.

However, issue description points 3, 4, 5, and 7 remain unresolved. The MO hasn't completed the 2023 FCP qualitative review and BTL execution by the end of the revalidation process. MRMC cannot conduct additional analysis based on the current evidence, leaving these bullet points open and unaddressed.
