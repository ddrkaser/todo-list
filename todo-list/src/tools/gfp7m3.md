The CB model operates under the assumption that each account or party is assigned to a single region. In cases where a message is associated with one or two internal accounts or parties, which may be located in different regions, the model may encounter challenges when trying to associate a message with its corresponding profiles, particularly when region codes are missing.

Furthermore, the presence of region codes also enables the model to differentiate and display results in different currencies for multiple jurisdictions within distinct regions. However, since the CB model doesn't involve currency conversion, the absence of region codes does not impact the model's output in this regard.
