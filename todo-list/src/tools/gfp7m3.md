Thank you for your patience. Please refer to the attached file, " for the draft of the issues. Please note that this list may change due to the following reasons:

1. The memo response, where new evidence was provided to address operational misalignment.
2. New evidence submitted on the GitLab Q&A board.
3. Internal alignment within MRMC across IB and FSI.
4. GIA feedback provided to MRMC as part of their issue assurance in March 2024 on DE.
5. Recent feedback from FCP.
6. Incorporation of language from the FRB MRA to ensure all activities were completed as per the response provided.
7. If possible, MRMC will provide example cases prior to the release of the validation report. Otherwise, they will be included in the final validation report to support MRMCâ€™s claims.

Thank you.
