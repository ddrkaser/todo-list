**Point 4:**
The BTL KMPI has been removed, and there is no evidence that ongoing BTL testing will be conducted. For this revalidation cycle, MRMC is not satisfied with the BTL testing results. Specifically, we raised several new issues this year:
- The input parameters for sample size calculation were not correctly defined.
- Hypothesis testing was not clearly outlined in the model documentation.
- The scoring test was conducted at the population group level, which is not appropriately designed.

Additionally, the threshold evaluation during this validation cycle was insufficient.

**Point 5:**
MRMC raised this concern because all rules, thresholds, and other model settings (e.g., scoring parameters) that can be tuned should be tested and justified. Otherwise, they should be adjusted to ensure the model operates as intended. The MO has proposed a remediation action to incorporate a robust evaluation of all model settings and thresholds to ensure they are appropriately tuned to UBS's specific risk profile and appetite. However, this robust evaluation of all model settings and thresholds has not been clearly documented, and there has been no conceptual soundness assessment provided for the current threshold settings.

Moreover, the scoring parameters were excluded from BTL testing, and no additional tests were conducted to evaluate their appropriateness. The MO did not provide a rationale for the initial scoring settings. While the MO referenced BTL testing results as a form of remediation, MRMC remains unsatisfied with these results, as noted in point 4.

For point 5, MRMC has raised the issue that "The adjustment of the scoring scale for 12 rules may undermine the conceptual soundness of the rules' objectives and risk coverage."

Additionally, for rule "," 3 recurrences within 15 days are worth 10 points, while 9 recurrences within 15 days are worth 40 points. However, there were no alerts generated between October 2022 and November 2023.
