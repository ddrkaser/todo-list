 has been deployed within the cloud-based MEGDP Architecture.

The purpose behind this non-material model change is to address follow-up fixes resulting from the NMMC for MEG2 migration. Notably, there are no alterations planned for the architecture of the model. Both the data flow and business flow will remain unchanged. This change is specifically aimed at updating UAT monitoring service controls, while keeping the core of the model untouched.

The classification of this model change as non-material is supported by several factors:

- The change is not expected to impact the model's methodology, use, or output.
- MO has furnished the MID ) with updates reflecting the implementation alongside UAT and F2B test results, as well as the necessary sign-offs.

MRMC has meticulously reviewed various test results and evidences, including Model Input Data and Schema Reconciliation, Datasets ID, Schema UUID, Datatypes, and Partition key comparison, Model Input Control Execution Evidence, Model Output Reconciliation, Output Control Execution, Model Code Comparison, UAT tests and sign-offs, QA sign-off, FtB tests, and BAT tests and sign-offs. All of these aspects have passed scrutiny.

After a thorough examination, MRMC has not identified any issues within the provided files and evidences. Consequently, MRMC acknowledges this non-material model change. Specifically, the updating of UAT monitoring service controls is seen as a technical upgrade to the existing environment. The model's performance has been comprehensively tested and supported by sign-offs from the model SMEs. The validation report is slated for an update to reflect this implementation as part of the next touch point.
