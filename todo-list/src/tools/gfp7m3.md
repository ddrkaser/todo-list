The evaluation of model stability lacks robustness, particularly in its consideration of the BTL test results. Additionally, the review of the BTL testing process has revealed gaps in the model documentation:

1. The methodology section of the model documentation fails to adequately describe aspects related to testing the calibration of parameters, including below the line, stress tests, benchmarks, and references to confirmatory assessments when necessary.
2. The model documentation still does not include a dedicated section addressing the design of sampling effectiveness.
