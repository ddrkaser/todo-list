The input data used is deemed relevant, covering historical financial crises, and maintains good quality with adequate granularity and frequency. MRMC considers the data controls to be sufficient.

While the data preparation process (filtering, mapping, and aggregation) is assessed as suitable, MRMC observed inconsistency between the global filters used and those listed in Table 4.5, prompting Issue 3 to be raised.

MRMC has identified several concerns:

1. **Quantitative Analysis on Outliers:** There's an inadequacy in the quantitative analysis concerning outliers, lacking a business judgment regarding the relevance of these outliers, leading to the raising of Issue 1.

2. **Macroeconomic Variable Selection and Transformation:** The justification for the selection and transformation of macroeconomic variables appears insufficient, contributing to the identification of Issue 2.

These issues warrant attention and resolution to ensure the robustness and reliability of the analysis and modeling process.
