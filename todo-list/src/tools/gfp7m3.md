To ensure that the checks are adequate and to identify data quality issues that could have a significant impact on the model, it is essential to conduct a systematic examination of the key data fields utilized within the model. However, MRMC faces a challenge in performing this test due to limited access to the EDW necessary to extract relevant data [031].

MRMC acknowledges that the model owner and upstream systems have implemented effective data quality controls, as discussed in analysis 2. These controls, including the ABC checking process and model user investigation procedures, are designed to ensure that the data used is complete, accurate, and consistent. Given the existence of these robust controls, which mitigate input data quality risks to a minimum, MRMC raises issue 1.
