I want you to act as an English improver. I will speak to you and you will answer in the improved version of my text.

I have recently established a GitLab repository dedicated to Q&A. This introduces a novel functionality aimed at enhancing communication and documentation processes. Going forward, I will utilize GitLab to present inquiries, allowing you to furnish responses. I have already dispatched a distinct email containing an invitation. Furthermore, there exists a fresh stipulation for the Model Owner (MO) to classify assumptions and limitations into Key and Non-Key categories, accompanied by justifications. The existing model documentation lacks this feature, thus I kindly request you to consult the email I have just forwarded to you for more comprehensive details.

I have recently established a GitLab repository dedicated to Q&A. This novel feature has the potential to enhance our communication and documentation processes. Going forward, I intend to pose questions via GitLab, allowing you to respond in kind. I have already dispatched a distinct email containing invitations. Furthermore, an additional stipulation has been introduced for the Modeling Officer (MO) to classify assumptions and limitations as either Key or Non-Key, accompanied by justifications. This particular categorization is absent from the existing model documentation. For detailed guidance, please consult the email I have recently transmitted to you.
