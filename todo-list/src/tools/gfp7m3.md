As the revalidation deadline is approaching, I would like to inquire about the status of the soft deletion question, BTL sample submission, and GitLab Q&A questions. Could you kindly provide your responses to each of these queries, and also inform us if there might be any potential postponement? I greatly appreciate your time and assistance.
