According to Analysis 11, for the NFRs where regression was the primary forecasting approach, most forecasted losses in the binding scenario, when compared to the worst 9 quarters, were under 60%. This discrepancy occurred because the dummy variables for extreme events could not be triggered in the face of future shocks. Consequently, this led to a final projection that was understressed under severe conditions. However, a more accurate comparison will be possible once the SME-adjusted final projections are accessible. This particular finding contributes to the resolution of Issue 5.
