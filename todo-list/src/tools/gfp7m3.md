The implementation of AML-C rules is considered conceptually sound and appropriate, as the rule monitoring aligns with transaction risk within correspondent business activities. However, the submitted model documentation lacks detail regarding Back-Testing and Benchmark Testing (BTL) related to the newly introduced Shell company activity monitoring. The robustness of these thresholds requires further evaluation. The model owner has not provided a sufficiently rigorous evaluation of all model settings and thresholds to ensure they are finely tuned to match 's specific risk profile and risk tolerance.

Therefore, MRMC has raised Issue 7, highlighting a gap in the model documentation pertaining to the BTL testing for Shell company scenarios.
