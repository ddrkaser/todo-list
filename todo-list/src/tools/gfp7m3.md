MRMC Review:
Upon reviewing the submitted evidence, MRMC has made the following observations:

1. The MPMC has not been changed as it is a global document, and triggers for CUSO AM may not be applicable to other jurisdictions. MRMC agrees with the justification provided and recommends the MO to document the description of the model maintenance process, including regular parameter updates and/or recalibration triggers, pursuant to Model Documentation Standards [P7].

2. MO has identified 3 recalibration triggers in the Model Confirmation [M7]:
   - KMPI #1 Manual Overrides [M7, Assessment 2. Test a]: MRMC agrees with the inclusion of this KMPI to account for poor model performance.
   - KMPI #5 Ad hoc feedback [M7, Assessment 2. Test a]: MRMC agrees with the inclusion of this KMPI to account for ad-hoc challenges to risk ratings.
   - SME output review [M7, Assessment 9]: MRMC recommends that this assessment be conducted with greater granularity than presenting risk ratings by peer group. If that is unfeasible, benchmarking (see analysis 7) should be performed annually with a set of synthetic data identical to the actual current population to ensure that the model performance is aligned with SME judgment. A metric must be defined to assess the outcome of the test.

However, MRMC found insufficient details regarding the execution and safeguarding of the aforementioned indicators, resulting in a lack of transparency concerning the detailed execution methodology and associated parties involved, as well as the rationale for overrides.

MRMC Conclusion:
MRMC confirms that this issue will remain open until transparency regarding the KMPIs is well-documented. A more granular SME review process or more frequent execution of benchmarking will be ideal.
