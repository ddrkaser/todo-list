MRMC acknowledges that the controls implemented in the model align fully with GMMCS requirements. However, MRMC has identified a discrepancy within the model documentation. Specifically, there is a disparity between Table 4: "Regulatory Context Specific to Each Alert Logic Modelled" and Table 13. In Table 4, the reference is made to the FINRA 2018 regulatory exam priorities letter for the model's regulatory context, whereas in Table 13, specific rules are mentioned as regulatory requirements.

As a result of this inconsistency, MRMC has raised an issue addressing the discrepancy within the model documentation.
