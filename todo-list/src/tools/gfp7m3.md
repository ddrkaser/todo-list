The Round Amount Activity Rule "PRJ-RND-SLL-ALL-A-S14-SST" exhibits 100% of infractions below a threshold of 40, with all 2094 out of 2094 (100%) infractions having a score of 20. This pattern suggests that the rule's break scores or parameters are not appropriately tuned, resulting in an inability to assign scores based on risk factors such as transaction value, recurrence, and prior history. When inquired about this, the MO explained that the Round Amount Activity Rule is capped at 20, which, when combined with other rules, increases the score but does not trigger a rule break on its own. However, MRMC has identified a lack of detail regarding how the final rule score is calculated and a need for additional testing to assess the impact of the score settings.
