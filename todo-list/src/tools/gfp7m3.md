As a general practice, transactions with zero values, which are considered non-productive, should not be included in Actimize tables. However, it's worth noting that in this specific case, only 42 out of a total of 1,982,826 transactions were identified to have zero values. This is regarded as a non-material observation due to the minimal number of transactions affected.
