**Point 4 and 5:**

M&M has revised the section on **Sampling from populations that do not meet the minimum theoretical sample size** in the model documentation ([M4]). If the minimum sample size calculated is greater than the available population generated by the applied threshold drop, the MO must determine the statistically significant minimum sample size. In such cases, the MO is required to review the entire population within that interval. Additionally, the MO may consider judgmental sampling, which involves a risk-based decision on sampling made by the MO in collaboration with FCP.

In extreme cases, where no population exists, the MO evaluates the underlying data to determine if further threshold drops are required for testing. For instance, if a rule has very low overall transactional volume, an additional threshold drop might not add meaningful value to the overall test. On the other hand, if descriptive statistics for these extreme cases suggest significant transactional volume exists below the threshold drop, this may indicate that the threshold settings are too high, necessitating further threshold drops. 

For the 2024 testing cycle, only one rule was categorized as an "extreme case." More details about this rule can be found in the issue closure documentation for validation issue 19.1 (closed).


**Point 7:**

MRMC raised this issue due to insufficient justification or assessment of the default value settings and rule scoring in the model documentation.

Based on the evidence in the model documentation ([M4, Section 8.3] and [MM-15]), the model went live in April 2021. Its thresholds were adjusted using OL plots, density distribution plots, and descriptive statistical analyses for each rule. The final thresholds were reviewed and approved by CAMLO. Initially, thresholds were set high to minimize noise and exclude normal transactional activity. 

For normally distributed transactions, 1 standard deviation from the mean corresponded to the 85th percentile. For right-skewed distributions, the mean + 1 standard deviation was positioned further to the right, depending on the skewness. For highly skewed distributions, the initial threshold was set at percentiles where most activity was concentrated. If the chosen percentile did not align with the ruleâ€™s red flags, the segment size was small, or other adjustments were warranted, the percentile value was revised accordingly by the MO.

MRMC reviewed the initial tuning process. In the first cycle, thresholds were set conservatively between the 75th and 90th percentiles. These thresholds were refined during the second cycle, leveraging productive alerts and descriptive statistics. The third cycle focused on adjusting scoring scales to reduce false positives and improve model efficiency. Risk was captured by setting thresholds at the segment-cluster level, with more conservative values applied to high and higher-risk accounts. For low and medium-risk accounts, thresholds were increased by 15% for a more lenient approach.

The MO also clarified that conceptual and statistical soundness assessments are interdependent, with results from both feeding into the parameter analysis documentation. These assessments must be conducted by the MO, incorporating M&M input and qualitative feedback/reviews from FCP to provide a risk-based perspective. However, MRMC recommends that all M&M inputs and FCP feedback be documented during future tuning processes to enhance transparency and robustness, enabling third-party reviewers to understand the rationale behind decisions and outcomes.

MRMC considers the model risk mitigated due to the following reasons:  
1. The 2024 BTL testing does not suggest threshold changes.  
2. High peaks in transaction value/volume for specific population groups increase the likelihood of monitoring due to value/volume spikes (refer to Analysis 6.1).  
3. [MM-15] sufficiently outlines the initial tuning process, ensuring the appropriateness of the initial parameter settings.  

It should also be noted that the current parameter settings will continue to be monitored and assessed through ongoing monitoring and annual tuning processes. Consequently, this point is deemed resolved and can be closed.
